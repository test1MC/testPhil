            <MadCap:concept term="FCUs" />Federal Credit Union Program and Procedures</h1>
        <p>The NCUA’s examination program institutes standards for a high quality examination process and establishes guidelines to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Identify and mitigate current and emerging risks to the share insurance fund</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure credit unions are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and directives</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Initiate appropriate corrective actions supported by a sufficiently detailed administrative record</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Facilitate timely resolution of supervisory concerns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This section of the NSPM&#160;explains how examiners will supervise federal credit unions in their districts. Supervision efforts will vary depending on the size of the credit union, the risk to the share insurance fund, and other circumstances as applicable. Supervision includes, but is not limited to, examinations, follow-up examinations, onsite contacts, offsite contacts, offsite monitoring, and trending analysis (for example, Call Report/FPR Trending).</p>
        <p>The examination and supervision program is the most important component of managing risk to the share insurance fund and protecting members. Refer to the <a href="../../Resources/APP-FISCUprogram/Examination and Supervision Comparison Matrix.docx">comparison of examination and supervision programs for federal credit unions and federally insured, state-chartered credit unions</a> for a high-level overview.</p>
