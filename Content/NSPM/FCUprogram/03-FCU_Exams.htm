            <MadCap:concept term="FCUs" />Federal Credit Union Examinations (WCC 10)</h2>
        <p>NCUA examiners will use WCC&#160;10 for FCU examinations, including SCUEP&#160;defined-scope examinations.  Examiners will reference the most recent <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/Instruction5000.flsnp" />, Appendix B, for required and baseline review areas. For an FCU&#160;SCUEP defined-scope examination, examiners will reference Appendix A for required Tier 1 review areas.</p>
        <p>As noted in the Instruction, examiners are responsible for using their judgment to adjust the scope to focus on areas of heightened risk. When opting out of baseline review areas, examiners will provide justification in the Scope module.</p>
