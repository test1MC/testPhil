No discussion in ALCO minutes of need to review or change policy during 10 month exam period. Policy thresholds are not perceived as reasonable. Limits are: loan-to-assets less than 90%, fixed assets 12%, and cash + short-term investments 4%. Fixed assets are 11.39% a loan-to-asset ratio of 90% would force the CU to borrow funds to support routine operations. High fixed assets due to prior RegFlex designation, FA will not be under 7% until 2014 based on current depreciation. Cash + short-term investments of 4% is not sufficient; historically, CU has ranged between 6 and 8% over past three years. See Overview and DOR.</td>
