            <MadCap:concept term="FCUs" />AIRES Exam Scope (Scope Module)</h3>
        <p>The Scope module is the permanent record of procedures performed during an examination/supervision contact. All WCC 10 examination procedures will be guided by the expectations outlined in the current <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Instruction5000.flsnp" />.</p>
        <h4>Field Staff</h4>
        <p>Field staff must thoroughly document the areas reviewed, the results, and the recommended action. Comments like "completed" or “inadequate” are not sufficient. Field staff must include a description of the area reviewed and results obtained, regardless of whether references to other work papers are included in the AIRES scope. </p>
        <p>The Scope module should be a comprehensive synopsis of what occurred during the examination or supervision contact. However, when applicable, the completed IRR workbook represents the scope for the IRR review and for scope module purposes, it is acceptable for field staff to state “Refer to IRR workbook” in the Results of Review section of the scope. Additionally, field staff may use the narrative conclusion for the final risk assessment. The IRR workbook framework includes the necessary scope elements of review steps (either required or baseline), fields to enter the results of each review step, a narrative conclusion (in the overall tab), and the IRR rating (high, moderate, or low).</p>
        <p>A <a href="SufficientScoping.htm">comprehensive scope</a> will enable the field staff of the next examination to become familiar with the history of the credit union in a shorter amount of time. Field staff must complete the Plans and Budget tab in the AIRES Scope module.</p>
        <p>When completing the Scope module and areas of review, all team members with an SME designation will include their designation, in parenthesis, next to their initials in the “Done by” column.</p>
        <h4>Examiner-in-Charge</h4>
        <p> EICs are responsible for the sufficiency of the AIRES Scope module. For team exams/supervision contacts, the EIC should complete the scope in advance of the rest of the team's arrival onsite.</p>
        <p>EICs need to continually evaluate the appropriateness of the scope and document procedures commensurate with the size and complexity of a credit union throughout the course of an examination. EICs will fully evaluate areas that represent a significant risk or potential risk to a credit union. </p>
        <h4>E&amp;I</h4>
        <p>E&amp;I will review, and update when necessary, the scope expectations in conjunction with changes in key risk indicators, economic conditions and regional concerns by January&#160;1 each year.</p>
