            <MadCap:concept term="FCUs" />Preliminary Risk Assessment</h3>
        <p>The preliminary risk assessment drives the initial scoping for a risk-based examination. This assessment is documented in the preliminary risk assessment tab of the AIRES Scope module. Field staff will focus on current and emerging risk indicators and evaluate preliminary risks. 
</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"> Field staff do not complete a preliminary risk assessment for defined-scope examinations. For these exams, examiners will check the SCUEP box in the Preliminary Risk Assessment tab, which will gray out the input fields on the tab.</p>
