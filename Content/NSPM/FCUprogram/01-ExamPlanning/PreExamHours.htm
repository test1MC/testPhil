            <MadCap:concept term="FCUs" />Pre-Exam Planning Hours</h3>
        <p>Field staff will use WCC 94, Pre-Exam Planning FCU, on weekly time reports to capture time spent pre-planning a federal credit union examination.  These hours are separate from, and in addition to, the budgeted hours for examining a credit union.  Field staff will document their pre-planning activities with the Pre-Exam Planning Questionnaire and upload it with the exam.</p>
        <p>Pre-exam hours must be recorded for each completed WCC&#160;10 exam. Exceptions to the budgeted time must be approved in writing by a supervisor, in advance.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"> The Pre-Exam Planning Questionnaire is available in the <a href="AIRES_Exam_Scope_Module.htm">AIRES Scope module</a>.</p>
