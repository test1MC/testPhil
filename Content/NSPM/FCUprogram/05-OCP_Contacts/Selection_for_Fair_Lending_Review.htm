            <MadCap:concept term="FCUs" />Federal Credit Union Selection for Fair Lending Review</h3>
        <p>The Office of Consumer Financial Protection selects federal credit unions for either an on-site fair lending examination or an off-site supervision contact based on a credit union’s risk profile. The number of federal credit unions selected will vary annually, based on available resources.</p>
        <h4>Field Recommendations </h4>
        <p>Given their direct knowledge of credit union lending practices, policies, and management strengths and weaknesses, field staff are in the best position to identify credit unions that have an elevated fair lending risk. OCFP requests recommendations from regional offices at least once each year.</p>
        <p>Regional offices should respond to OCFP’s request with the name and charter number of credit unions with elevated fair lending risks, as well as a brief description of the basis for the recommendation. OCFP is particularly interested in identifying credit unions that have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Lending policies or practices that discriminate on a prohibited basis</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Lending personnel who have made negative statements towards protected groups or individuals (including documentation of such comments in loan files)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Member or employee complaints alleging lending discrimination</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Systemic Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B) or HMDA (Regulation C) violations</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Discretionary loan underwriting or pricing practices, when present with limited or no monitoring or internal controls</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Lending distinctions tied to geography that may disproportionately impact protected groups or individuals</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Lending programs available only to specific groups, individuals, or select employee groups</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Particular incentives created by employee compensation structures that may disproportionately impact protected groups or individuals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regional offices can submit high risk cases to OCFP on an ad hoc basis. OCFP will attempt to work high-risk referrals into the current year’s schedule.</p>
        <p>OCFP normally schedules fair lending examinations independently of safety and soundness examinations. However, OCFP will attempt to schedule concurrently if the regional office expresses a preference.</p>
        <h4>Regional Office Notification</h4>
        <p>Upon selecting a credit union for a fair lending examination or off-site supervision contact, OCFP will notify the appropriate regional office and seek its input before contacting the credit union.</p>
        <p>In notifications to regional offices, OCFP will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Provide a list of federal credit unions selected for a fair lending examination along with a summary of the basis for selection and any preselected focal points that will be reviewed</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Provide a list of federal credit unions selected for an off-site supervision contact along with a summary of the basis for selection</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">For each planned fair lending examination, request the date of the next safety and soundness examination, if available, and a point of contact (supervisory examiner or district examiner)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">For each planned fair lending examination or supervision contact, request information on unusual circumstances that OCFP should consider before proceeding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>OCFP will consider information provided by regional offices before making a final determination on fair lending examinations, supervision contacts, and dates.&#160;OCFP will courtesy copy the appropriate regional office on credit union notification letters.</p>
