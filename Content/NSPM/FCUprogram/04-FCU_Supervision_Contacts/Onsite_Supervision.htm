        <p>An onsite supervision contact is more limited in scope than a follow-up examination. Examiners will typically perform an onsite supervision contact to review one major problem area, to hold a joint conference if it could not be completed as part of the exam, and/or to review the credit union’s compliance with a DOR, etc.</p>
        <p>Examiners will perform onsite supervision contacts as needed between regular or follow-up examinations based on the nature and severity of the problems or as their supervisor requires. Examiners will need to make each contact a results-oriented contact designed to achieve corrective action.</p>
        <p>Credit unions with significant recordkeeping concerns require an onsite supervision contact focused on ensuring adequate attention to and correction of problems. See the <a href="../../AuditsRecordkeeping/05-Significant_Recordkeeping_Concern.htm">Significant Recordkeeping Concerns</a> section of the NSPM for additional guidance for performing supervision contacts for credit unions that have significant recordkeeping concerns.</p>
