        <p>Offsite supervision is conducted somewhere other than at the credit union. At times, examiners will perform offsite supervision to follow up on outstanding concerns, review the credit union’s response to a DOR, review monthly financial and/or board packages, respond to regional or national requests regarding credit unions in their district, or otherwise supervise, counsel, or interact with the credit union remotely (for example, phone, email). Examiners will not change a credit union’s composite CAMEL rating during a WCC 27 contact.</p>
