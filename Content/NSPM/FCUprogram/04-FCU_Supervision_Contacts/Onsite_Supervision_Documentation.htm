            <MadCap:concept term="FCUs" />Onsite Supervision Contact Documentation</h4>
        <p>Examiners document an onsite supervision contact by uploading an AIRES file. At a minimum, the AIRES upload must include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">AIRES historical download, Exam.xls, and all critical input areas</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Sections within the Scope module that were the subject of the contact including pertinent final risk ratings. Examiners will document their explanations of any change of final risk ratings in the scope. For any areas not reviewed in the Scope module, “n/a” or “DNR” (did not review) will suffice</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Written narrative report provided to the credit union if applicable (for example, Examination Overview, Examiner’s Findings, etc.). Use the Confidential Section to document additional information when a report is not provided to the credit union and in place of a supervision contact memo</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Completed EMC</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Updated <a href="../../../Resources/APP-DistrictMgmt/Supervision Chronology Report.docx#appendix1a">Supervision Chronology Report</a> saved in the examination directory for a CAMEL 3 with assets $250 million and greater, and CAMEL 4 or 5</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Any other information necessary to support the scope and time spent on the contact (for example, updated and completed DOR module if focus of contact was to review compliance with DOR items, completed Consumer Compliance Violations module in AIRES if focus was to review compliance violations, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examiners will discuss their findings and recommendations during an exit meeting and issue a written report to the officials if the contact results in required action or changes are made to CAMEL or risk ratings.</p>
