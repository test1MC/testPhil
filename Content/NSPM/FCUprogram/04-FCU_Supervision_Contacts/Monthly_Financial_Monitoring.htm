            <MadCap:concept term="FCUs" />Monthly Financial Monitoring (WCC 27)</h3>
        <p>Examiners must trend monthly financial data for the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any CAMEL 4 or 5 credit union with more than $250M in assets</li>
            <li>Any CAMEL 3 credit union with more than $1B in assets</li>
            <li>All cases assigned to the Division of Special Actions</li>
            <li>All troubled institutions in which financial condition is a concern and the credit union represents significant risk to the share insurance fund (as in the case of a large, troubled institution)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examiners must trend the data using SATEX or an equivalent tool. Examiners will charge this type of offsite supervision to <a href="Offsite_Supervision.htm">WCC 27</a> and will upload a Minimal Contact.</p>
        <p>Examiners should make every effort to receive monthly financials directly from a credit union. For example, a section of the DOR could request financial and/or board packets be sent on a monthly basis to the examiner. The supervisor will, on a case by case basis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Notify the FCU when there is a change in district assignment or the monthly financial data is no longer needed</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine the format of the examiner's analysis and reporting requirements</li>
        </ul>
