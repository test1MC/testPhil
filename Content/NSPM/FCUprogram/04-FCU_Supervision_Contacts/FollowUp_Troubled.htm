        <h3>Follow-Up Examinations for Troubled/Problem Federal Credit Unions (WCC 22)</h3>
        <p>Follow-up examinations are more comprehensive than other onsite supervision contacts and require an analysis of data to support the CAMEL ratings and administrative action recommendations. Examiners will support in the scope, or by other means that can be made part of the administrative record, all of the critical problem areas identified during the regular examination. Before uploading an AIRES contact, examiners will indicate on the AIRES Exam Management Console (EMC) whether the supervision contact was a follow-up examination (yes/no button on the Completion Information tab in AIRES). Examiners typically only perform follow-up examinations on CAMEL 3, 4, or 5 credit unions.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">A <i>follow-up examination</i> is a type of onsite supervision contact that applies to both federal credit unions and federally insured, state-charted credit unions.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, examiners will perform a follow-up examination, which must include a joint conference with the board of directors, during the following intervals:</p>

        <h4>Timeframe Exceptions for Follow-Up Examinations</h4>
        <p>Examiners will consult their supervisor and request an extension via email if they cannot complete a follow-up examination within the required timeframe. The guidelines for requesting an extension are:</p>

        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="FCUs" />CAMEL 3, 4 or 5 FCUs with less than $50 million in assets may receive an onsite supervision contact in lieu of a follow-up examination. The supervision contact or follow-up examination will occur at the frequency described below.</p>

        <p>SEs/examiners will use sound judgment to determine, on a case-by-case basis, the completion requirements for any FCU meeting these criteria (within the 210 days for CAMEL 4 or 5 FCUs), tailoring the supervision needs to the credit union. Regional Directors and supervisors may require different completion timeframes or supervision plans for specific risks in a specific credit union.</p>
        <p>Examiners will support in the scope, or by other means that can be made part of the administrative record, all of the critical problem areas identified during the regular examination. The contact must include a joint conference with the board of directors.</p>
        <p>Each region will establish monitoring procedures for follow-up examinations and timeframe extensions, until a national system is developed and implemented. The ARDP will review the applicable report(s) and share them with the supervisors to evaluate appropriateness and timeliness of completion contacts to ensure a quality and timely supervision program.</p>
        <h4>Follow-Up Examination Documentation</h4>
        <p>Examiners document a follow-up examination by uploading an AIRES file, and charging time to WCC 22. At a minimum, the AIRES upload must include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">AIRES historical download, Exam.xls, and all critical input areas</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Sections in the Scope module that were the subject of the follow-up examination, including pertinent risk ratings. Examiners will document their explanations of any change of final risk ratings in the scope. For any areas not reviewed in the Scope module, “n/a” or “DNR” (did not review) will suffice</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Documentation regarding compliance with any outstanding administrative actions (LUA, PWL, etc.,) in the Status Update</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Documentation regarding compliance with any outstanding Net Worth Restoration Plan (NWRP) / Revised Business Plan (RBP) in the Status Update</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Documentation of compliance or non-compliance with previous DOR items and updated DOR module</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Written narrative report provided to the credit union (for example, Examination Overview, Examiner’s Findings, etc.)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Completed EMC including all questions and the date of the exit meeting and/or joint conference (a joint conference is required for all CAMEL 3, 4, and 5s, unless the supervisor approves an exception. In the event a quorum is not present, examiners will instruct the credit union’s management to note it in the board minutes and provide documentation to the examiner regarding whether management adopted the DOR at the next board meeting)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Updated <a href="../../../Resources/APP-DistrictMgmt/Supervision Chronology Report.docx#appendix1a">Supervision Chronology Report</a> saved in the examination directory for a CAMEL 3 with assets $250 million and greater, and CAMEL 4 or 5</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Consumer Compliance Violations module in AIRES, if applicable</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Completed Confidential Section</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Examiners are required to issue a report to the credit union for follow-up examinations. Examiners will <a href="../../DistrictMgmt/08-AdministrativeItems/Deliver_Report_CU_Officials.htm">deliver the report as they would an examination report</a>. Examiners must discuss required corrective actions, administrative actions, and provide relevant supporting sections of the report to the officials during the joint conference (for example, DOR, Examiner’s Findings, and other appropriate work papers such as the Supplementary Facts).</p>
