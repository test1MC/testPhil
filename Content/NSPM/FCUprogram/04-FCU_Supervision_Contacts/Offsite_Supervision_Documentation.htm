            <MadCap:concept term="FCUs" />Offsite Supervision Contact Documentation for Offsite Contacts Eight Hours or Longer</h4>
        <p>A <a href="../../DistrictMgmt/08-AdministrativeItems/AIRES-MinimalUpload.htm">minimal AIRES upload</a> or a “minimal contact” is required for all WCC 27 offsite contacts of eight hours or more. Examiners document an offsite supervision contact of eight hours or more by uploading a “Minimal Contact” report in AIRES and charging time to WCC 27.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, the AIRES upload must include a completed EMC with documentation of the contact scope, progress, conclusions, recommendations, etc. in either the “Examiner Comments” section on the Completion Information tab of the EMC or, if more room is needed, in the Executive Summary or Supplementary Facts.</p>
        <p>An AIRES upload with a completed Scope module for offsite supervision is only required for a material change in risk ratings. Otherwise, the Scope module is optional.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">Minimal uploads don't include MS&#160;Word and Excel files. To include these types of files, you may need to bypass the "minimal upload."</p>
        <h4>Offsite Supervision Contact Documentation for Offsite Contacts Shorter Than Eight Hours</h4>
        <p>Time spent performing offsite supervision in increments less than eight hours for the same credit union should be aggregated and uploaded on a quarterly basis. If the aggregate time charged in a quarter is less than eight hours, an AIRES upload is not required.</p>
        <div class="redacted" MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted">
            <p>This does not apply to contacts for credit unions with BSA violations that must be resolved by a specific date. Examiners will complete an AIRES upload for BSA-related resolution contacts. See the <a href="../../BSAenforcement/BSA_Enforcement.htm">BSA Enforcement</a> section of the NSPM&#160;for more information.</p>
