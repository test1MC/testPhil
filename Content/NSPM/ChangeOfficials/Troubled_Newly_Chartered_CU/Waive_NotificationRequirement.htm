            <MadCap:concept term="ChangeOfficials" />Waiver of 30 Day Notification Requirement</h2>
        <p>In some instances, a credit union may request a waiver of the 30 day advance notification requirement and fill a vacancy until the region has time to process their application package. In these cases, the regional office can issue a letter with an interim approval until the region has time to process the request. (Use the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-ChangeOfOfficials/Waive 30-Day Notification Requirement.docx">Waive 30-Day Notification Requirement</a> template.) </p>
        <p>No waiver request is required for newly-elected members of the board or directors or credit committee.&#160; These individuals may begin serving immediately so long as the credit union files a complete notice within 48 hours of the election.</p>
