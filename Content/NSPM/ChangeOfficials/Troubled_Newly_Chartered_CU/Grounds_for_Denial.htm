            <MadCap:concept term="ChangeOfficials" />Grounds for Denial</h2>
        <p>The Regional Director will provide specific reasons for denial based on the authority of <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2a54edcfca749e997a08c3ea7cc51e95&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14(e)</a> of <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Regs/Pages/Regulations.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a>. All disapprovals require the concurrence of the Office of General Counsel (OGC). The Regional Director should forward any draft disapproval letter to OGC for review and concurrence at least ten calendar days prior to the expiration date for the Regional Director to respond to the application. Given the short timeframes for acting on these requests regional office staff may contact OGC for assistance at any point during their review process.</p>
        <p>The Regional Director will weigh the factors listed below, and will deny the request if, on balance, the issues relating to the individual's competence, experience, character, or integrity are such that it is not in the best interest of the credit union's members or the public for the individual to be employed by or associated with the credit union.</p>
        <p>Factors which may support denial include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Criminal convictions<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Certain criminal convictions may result in an automatic prohibition under §205(d) of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/FCUAct.flsnp" /> and eliminate any need for any review pursuant to <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2a54edcfca749e997a08c3ea7cc51e95&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" />. Other criminal convictions may not. Regional office staff should contact OGC whenever an applicant has a criminal conviction.</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Unsatisfactory work performance in the financial sector</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Lack of work experience in relevant areas of financial management</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Poor personal financial condition or credit history, particularly as it relates to losses caused to financial institutions</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Omission of significant information relevant for job consideration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The mere presence of one or more of these factors in a particular case should not automatically result in disapproval. Rather, when determining whether these or other factors are disqualifying it is important to consider whether, given the specific circumstances surrounding the potentially disqualifying factor, it has a sufficient nexus to the competence, experience, character or integrity necessary for the particular position so as to be disqualifying.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f7487481e89b2eb482b7ff41baabd9c8&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr713_main_02.tpl" target="_blank">Part 713</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> requires certain minimum bond coverage for credit union employees and officials. Therefore, if an applicant is unable to secure the required minimum coverage they may not serve and there is no need for any review under <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2a54edcfca749e997a08c3ea7cc51e95&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14(e)</a>.</p>
        <p>If the application is not approved, DOS will send a copy of the appropriate denial letter to the credit union, the examiner, and the supervisor by using their preferred expedited mail delivery service. DOS will also send the individual a separate denial letter. The letters will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Summarize the reasons for denial, providing specific reasoning as to why the application is denied. When the applicant provides an explanation for potentially disqualifying information any denial should discuss why on balance these mitigating factors are insufficient</li>
            <li>Inform the credit union and the individual of their rights to file a written request for reconsideration to the Regional Director within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice of denial, or file an appeal directly with the NCUA Board</li>
        </ul>
