            <MadCap:concept term="ChangeOfficials" />Request for Reconsideration and/or Appeal</h2>
        <p>As <a href="Grounds_for_Denial.htm">stated in the NSPM</a>, the NCUA&#160;will inform a credit union of its option to request reconsideration by the Regional Director or the option to appeal the decision directly to the NCUA Board in a denial letter. A&#160;credit union's request for reconsideration must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be submitted to the Regional Director  in writing</li>
            <li>Include any relevant previously omitted material and/or relevant documents not previously available</li>
            <li>Contain the specific reasons why the NCUA should reconsider the denial</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examiners should not discourage a credit union from filing an appeal. There is a 15-day window to file an appeal following notice of denial. The credit union may appeal the decision before or after requesting Regional Director reconsideration. <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=cceb0d379e0e56597c3020896952fa8c&amp;mc=true&amp;node=sp12.7.747.j&amp;rgn=div6" target="_blank">Part 747 (subpart J)</a> of <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Regs/Pages/Regulations.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a> provides guidance for the appeal.</p>
