            <MadCap:concept term="ChangeOfficials" />Change of Officials for Troubled and Newly Chartered Credit Unions</h1>
        <p>Under <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=fbf6586ef8c219c24ddd7fa31c7247f9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14</a> of <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Regs/Pages/Regulations.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a>, federally insured credit unions meeting certain conditions (see the <a href="Troubled_Newly_Chartered_CU/Affected_CUs.htm">Affected Credit Unions section</a> of the NSPM) must obtain the Regional Director's approval for personnel changes (board of directors, credit or Supervisory Committee, or senior executive officer) at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the change, or within 48 hours of election at an annual membership meeting. For state-chartered federally insured credit unions, the NCUA will consult with the appropriate state supervisory authority before making a final decision.</p>
        <p>The regulation requires written notice from the credit union and Regional Director approval before an individual can begin service at the credit union. The only exceptions to this requirement are if the credit union requests and the Regional Director waives prior notice(<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=fbf6586ef8c219c24ddd7fa31c7247f9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14(c)(2)(i)</a>) and in the case of the election of a new member of the board of directors or credit committee member (<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=fbf6586ef8c219c24ddd7fa31c7247f9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14(c)(2)(ii)</a>).</p>
        <p>In the case of a newly elected member of the board of directors or credit committee member, the 30-day prior notice is “automatically waived” and the individual may begin serving but, within 48 hours, a complete notice as required under the regulation must be submitted to the Regional Director. If a Regional Director grants a prior notice waiver or in the case of a new elected director or credit committee member, the Regional Director can still deny the individual and will have 30 days after receipt of the notice and information.</p>
