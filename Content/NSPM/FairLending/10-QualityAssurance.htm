        <h1>Quality Assurance</h1>
        <p>CCPO’s fair lending program officer (or designee) will perform a written quality control review (QCR) of each fair lending examination. QCRs will evaluate and address:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The adequacy of problem identification and corrective actions</li>
            <li>Whether examination documentation provides a sufficient administrative record to support the review of focal points, and OCFP’s findings and recommendations</li>
            <li>Consistency in OCFP’s application of DORs, Examiner’s Findings, Loan Exceptions, and recommendations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The fair lending program officer will review each fair lending supervision contact and document the review for the CCPO Director in a summary spreadsheet. Supervision contact reviews will evaluate supervision contact findings, recommended corrective actions, and recommendations for follow-up work. The fair lending program officer will advise the CCPO Director of any recommendation for follow-up work noted in a fair lending supervision contact.</p>
        <p>CCPO’s fair lending program officer will provide QCRs to CCPO analysts within 45 days of examination completion.</p>
