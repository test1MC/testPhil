        <h1>Federal Credit Union Selection for Review</h1>
        <p>OCFP selects federal credit unions for either an on-site fair lending examination or an off-site supervision contact based on a credit union’s risk profile. Federal credit unions selected for a fair lending examination or off-site supervision contact exhibit elevated fair lending risk characteristics. Criteria used to determine a federal credit union’s fair lending risk may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HMDA outliers determined from review of annual HMDA reports</li>
            <li>Fair lending findings or violations noted in recent safety and soundness examinations</li>
            <li>Elevated compliance risk noted in recent safety and soundness examinations</li>
            <li>The volume, types, or complexity of the lending products and services offered, or types of communities served</li>
            <li>Lending discrimination complaints against the credit union</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The number of federal credit unions selected may vary each year based on available resources. OCFP may also participate in a fair lending review of a federal credit union during an examination (WCC 10).</p>
        <h2>Field Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Given their direct knowledge of credit union lending practices, policies, and management strengths and weaknesses, field staff are in the best position to identify credit unions having elevated fair lending risk. OCFP is particularly interested in identifying credit unions having:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lending policies or practices that discriminate on a prohibited basis.</li>
            <li>Lending personnel who have made negative statements towards protected groups or individuals (including documentation of such comments in loan files).</li>
            <li>Member or employee complaints alleging lending discrimination.</li>
            <li>Systemic ECOA (Regulation B) or HMDA (Regulation C) violations.</li>
            <li>Discretionary loan underwriting or pricing practices, when present with limited or no monitoring or internal controls.</li>
            <li>Lending distinctions tied to geography that may disproportionately impact protected groups or individuals.</li>
            <li>Lending programs that are available to specific groups, individuals, or select employee groups, but not the entire field of membership.</li>
            <li>Particular incentives created by employee compensation structures that may disproportionately impact protected groups or individuals.</li>
        </ul>
