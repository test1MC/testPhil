        <h1>Off-Site Fair Lending Exams (WCC 33)
</h1>
        <p>NCUA staff use Contact Type 33, OCFP Off-site Fair Lending Supervision Contact, for off-site fair lending reviews.</p>
        <p>Off-site supervision contacts are used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine whether a credit union has adequate policies, procedures, and internal controls to ensure compliance with fair lending laws and regulations.</li>
            <li>Educate credit unions on fair lending and consumer protection laws and regulations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Off-site supervision contacts are more limited in scope than on-site fair lending examinations. Supervision contacts generally include a fair lending baseline review with no transaction testing.</p>
        <p>The analyst- or examiner-in-charge will communicate with federal credit union staff throughout each off-site supervision contact. At the conclusion of the off-site supervision contact, the federal credit union will receive a written report and the analyst- or examiner-in-charge will hold an exit meeting by phone. District examiners will be notified in advance of meeting dates and times.</p>
        <p>If an off-site supervision contact identifies possible discriminatory practices or significant findings of non-compliance with fair lending laws and regulations, the federal credit union will be considered for a future fair lending examination.</p>
