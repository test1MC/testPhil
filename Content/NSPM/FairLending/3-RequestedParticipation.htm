        <p>When requested by an SSA, OCFP may participate or assist on a fair lending examination conducted at a state-chartered credit union by its SSA. The OCFP Director will determine whether to participate on such examinations. The determination to participate will depend on available resources. Depending on the size and scope of an examination, OCFP may request assistance with the examination from the region whose coverage includes the state requesting participation.</p>
