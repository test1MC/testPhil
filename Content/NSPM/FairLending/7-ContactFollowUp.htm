        <h1>Contact Follow-Up</h1>
        <p>OCFP will provide recommendations for corrective action when deficiencies are identified in a fair lending examination or supervision contact. OCFP is responsible for follow-up of compliance with corrective actions, including, but not limited to Examiner’s Findings and DOR items.</p>
        <p>OCFP will track DOR timeframes for completion and follow-up with credit union management consistent with the standards outlined in the <a href="../AdminRemedies/AdminRemedies.htm">Administrative Remedies</a> section of this Manual. Resolution of corrective action items should be documented in an AIRES upload (WCC 33).</p>
        <p>During onsite examinations and supervision contacts, district examiners will consult with OCFP before declaring an Examiner’s Finding or DOR item resolved.</p>
