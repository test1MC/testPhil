        <p>CAMEL and risk ratings are assigned by district examiners according to safety and soundness guidelines and will not be changed during a fair lending examination or supervision contact. Fair lending examiners can make recommendations to the appropriate region to adjust CAMEL and risk ratings, when serious violations are noted.</p>
        <p>The analyst- or examiner-in-charge will include additional work papers completed which contribute to the administrative record.</p>
        <p>Regional offices, supervisory examiners, and district examiners receive notice of fair lending examination or supervision contact completion and access to the report through the AIRES email notification process.</p>
