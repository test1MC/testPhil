        <h1>Administrative Remedies</h1>
        <p>Many of the administrative remedies used by safety and soundness examiners are also available to the OCFP. The timeframes for taking administrative actions take into account OCFP’s process for consulting with other NCUA offices, federal or state financial regulators, and, as appropriate, the credit union. This process is important in resolving any factual disputes and addressing potential legal issues prior to taking a formal agency action.</p>
        <h2>Report of Administrative Actions</h2>
        <p>The OCFP will monitor and follow-up on any outstanding administrative action items. OCFP will maintain a record of all informal and formal administrative actions including, but not limited to, OCFP Director Letters, PWLs, and civil money penalties. The OCFP will provide a quarterly report of these informal and formal administrative actions to the E&amp;I&#160;Director. The report will include administrative actions newly issued, currently outstanding (with the exception of OCFP Director and CCPO Division Director Letters), and those canceled since the last report.</p>
        <h2>Document of Resolution</h2>
        <p>CCPO analysts will note the person(s) responsible, a citation for the problem, and the timeframe for taking corrective action in the DOR. Credit union management’s failure to address DOR items may result in elevated administrative action (for example, OCFP Director Letter, PWL). See the <a href="../AdminRemedies/03-DOR/DOR.htm">Document of Resolution</a> section of the NSPM for additional guidance on issuing DORs.</p>
        <h2>OCFP Director / CCPO Division Director Letters</h2>
        <p>The OCFP Director Letter is used when a credit union has serious and/or persistent problem areas that are not being adequately resolved. The OCFP Director Letter may be issued in conjunction with a fair lending examination to emphasize an area of concern. Typically, the CCPO Division Director Letter is used to respond to a first-time late or non-filed HMDA Report.</p>
        <p>OCFP will consult with the appropriate regional office prior to sending an OCFP Director or CCPO Division Director letter in connection with a fair lending exam or HMDA late or non-filer matter. OCFP will provide the appropriate regional office and, if applicable, the appropriate SSA, with a copy of the OCFP Director or CCPO Division Director Letter.</p>

        <h2>Preliminary Warning Letter</h2>
        <p>A Preliminary Warning Letter is a warning of potential formal administrative action if corrective action is not taken. The OCFP may issue a PWL when a credit union has not adequately resolved serious and/or persistent problem areas identified during a fair lending examination, or in response to repeated late-filed or non-filed HMDA reports. A PWL will not be issued as a result of an OCFP fair lending off-site supervision contact.</p>
        <p>OCFP will consult with the appropriate regional office prior to issuing a PWL in connection with a fair lending exam or HMDA late or non-filer matter. OCFP will provide the appropriate regional office and, if applicable, the appropriate SSA, with a copy of the PWL.</p>
        <p>For a <b>fair lending examination</b>, the PWL should be issued to the credit union within 60 days after completion of the exam.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OCFP will forward the draft PWL to the appropriate regional office for review.</li>
            <li>Within 10 days of receiving the draft PWL, the regional office will review the PWL and notify OCFP of its review and any recommended changes. If the regional office is aware of additional safety and soundness concerns, it may propose issuing a PWL directly from the Region to address both fair lending and safety and soundness concerns.</li>
            <li>OCFP will schedule a follow-up contact within 120 days of issuing a PWL to assess the credit union’s compliance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a <b>HMDA report</b>, a PWL is issued after the credit union’s second HMDA late filing or non-filing within a five-year period. The PWL should be issued to the credit union within 90 days of the availability of HDMA data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The PWL should require a written response from the credit union to OCPF, with a copy to the appropriate regional office, within 30 days of receipt of the PWL indicating what actions the credit union has taken or plans to take to address the HMDA late or non-filing matter.</li>
            <li>The OCFP will review the credit union’s response and determine whether corrective action plans are appropriate.</li>
            <li>If the OCFP determines corrective actions plans are not appropriate, OCPF will schedule an off-site supervision contact within 240 days of the availability of HDMA data to counsel the credit union on appropriate policies and procedures.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Civil Money Penalty</h2>
        <p>The OGC must be consulted on all Civil Money Penalty actions and they must be approved as outlined in the NCUA’s Delegations of Authority. Additionally, the OCFP will consult with the appropriate regional office prior to seeking a CMP against a credit union. The OCFP will provide the appropriate regional office and, if applicable, the appropriate SSA with a copy of the CMP.</p>
        <p>Federal law provides that a CMP may be assessed against a credit union for a late-filed or non-filed HMDA report. A CMP is typically issued after the credit union’s third late HMDA filing or non-filing within a five-year period. The CMP should be issued to the credit union within 120 days after the availability of HDMA data.</p>
        <h2>DOJ Referrals</h2>
        <p>Under the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title15/html/USCODE-2011-title15-chap41-subchapIV.htm" target="_blank">Equal Credit Opportunity Act</a>, regulators, including the NCUA, must refer a matter to DOJ whenever the agency has reason to believe that a credit union has engaged in a pattern or practice of discouraging or denying applications for credit in violation of 15 U.SC. §1691(a) of ECOA. The initiating office (OCFP, in the case of a fair lending examination conducted by that office, or the applicable regional office or ONES in the case of a fair lending violation addressed during a safety and soundness examination (WCC 10)) will consult with each other and OGC prior to taking any action to refer cases to DOJ. OGC will deliver all referrals for ECOA violations to DOJ.</p>
