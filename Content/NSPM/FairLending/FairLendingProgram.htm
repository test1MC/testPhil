        <h1>Fair Lending Examination Program and Procedures</h1>
        <p>The Office of Consumer Financial Protection was created in 2010 to demonstrate the increased importance the NCUA places on consumer protection. The OCFP is responsible for consumer compliance policy, program, and rulemaking, fair lending examinations, interagency coordination for consumer financial protection and compliance issues, consumer complaints, and financial literacy programs. The OCFP also handles chartering, charter conversions, bylaw amendments, field of membership expansions, and low-income designations.</p>
        <p>With the exception of federal credit unions that have more than $10 billion in assets (which are under the supervisory authority of the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/" target="_blank">CFPB</a> for consumer financial protection matters), the NCUA enforces the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title15/html/USCODE-2011-title15-chap41-subchapIV.htm" target="_blank">Equal Credit Opportunity Act</a> and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=51d87981a7657ac00eddf5aa135e1e16&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt12.8.1002&amp;rgn=div5" target="_blank">Regulation B</a> in federal credit unions, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=51d87981a7657ac00eddf5aa135e1e16&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt12.8.1003&amp;rgn=div5" target="_blank">Regulation C</a> in all federally insured credit unions. The OCFP’s Division of Consumer Compliance Policy and Outreach is responsible for conducting fair lending examinations and off-site supervision contacts, as well as HMDA enforcement.</p>
        <p>The NCUA also assesses compliance with the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2009-title42/html/USCODE-2009-title42-chap45-subchapI.htm" target="_blank">Fair Housing Act</a> and reports violations to the Department of Justice.  The NCUA conducts on-site fair lending examinations and off-site supervision contacts with federal credit unions to assess compliance with fair lending laws using the FFIEC <a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/fairlend.pdf" target="_blank">Interagency Fair Lending Examination Procedures</a> (Aug. 2009).
