        <h2>Timeframe to Complete and Upload Fair Lending Examinations/Supervision Contacts</h2>
        <p>Except for minor differences with start dates, fair lending examiners will complete and upload all examinations/supervision contacts consistent with standards outlined in <a href="../DistrictMgmt/00-DistrictManagement.htm">District Management</a> section of the this manual. The start date for a fair lending examination is the date the analyst- or examiner-in-charge first charges time to the examination, and generally corresponds to the date pre-examination scoping begins. The start date for a fair lending supervision contact is the date the analyst- or examiner-in-charge receives supervision contact materials from a credit union.</p>
        <h2>Notifying a Credit Union of a Fair Lending Examination or Supervision Contact</h2>
        <p>OCFP will provide adequate advance notice before starting a fair lending examination or supervision contact.  When a fair lending examination runs concurrently with a safety and soundness examination, OCFP will coordinate all scheduling efforts with the district examiner.</p>
        <p>Unless special circumstances exist, OCFP will give credit union officials a minimum notice of four weeks. The CCPO Division Director must approve notification periods of less than four weeks. This approval will be documented in the Confidential Section of the report.</p>
        <p>As part of the notification process, OCFP will prepare a notification cover letter and items needed list for fair lending examinations and supervision contacts. OCFP will revise the items needed list to meet the needs of the particular examination or contact. OCFP will provide the notification package to the credit union at least four weeks prior to the fair lending examination or supervision contact start date.</p>
