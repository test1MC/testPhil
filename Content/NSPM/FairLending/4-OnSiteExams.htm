        <h1>On-Site Fair Lending Exams (WCC 03)
</h1>
        <p>NCUA staff use Contact Type 03, OCFP On-site Fair Lending Review, for on-site fair lending examinations. 

Fair lending examinations are used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enforce credit union compliance with fair lending laws and regulations and HMDA and Regulation C compliance, and strengthen credit unions’ fair lending programs through risk-based examination procedures, including transaction testing</li>
            <li>Educate credit unions on fair lending and consumer protection laws and regulations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fair lending examinations are risk-based and conducted in accordance with the August 2009 <a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/fairlend.pdf" target="_blank">FFIEC Interagency Fair Lending Examination Procedures</a>.
</p>
        <p>At the conclusion of the exam, a federal credit union will receive a written fair lending examination report, and the analyst- or examiner-in-charge will conduct an on-site meeting to discuss the findings. District examiners will be notified in advance of meeting dates and times, and may attend if they choose.
