            <MadCap:concept term="Derivatives" />Derivatives Application Appeal Process</h2>
        <p>A federal credit union may submit an appeal to the NCUA Board within 60 calendar days of receiving notification that the NCUA has denied derivatives authority. The denial letter provided by the NCUA will inform the credit union of its right to appeal the decision directly to the NCUA Board. NCUA staff will not discourage a credit union from filing an appeal.</p>
        <p>A credit union must submit an appeal in writing. The request for appeal should address the specific reason(s) the NCUA should reconsider its decision, and must include any relevant material previously submitted. <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5f4be1c2e236e50f7cb2f17f82164fbd&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.703_1111&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">Section 703.111(d)</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> discusses the appeal.</p>
        <p>The field office will create and maintain the <a href="../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Information Administration Log (DIAL).docx#appendix6ZZ">Derivatives Information Administration Log (DIAL)</a> of all appeals to maintain accurate records that reflect the actions described in this section.</p>
        <p>Once an appeal is logged, the field office will send a letter to the credit union to acknowledge the appeal (see the <a href="../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Appeal/Acknowledge Appeal.docx">Acknowledge Appeal</a> template) and provide a status update.</p>
        <p>The field director will provide the Board an analysis of each appeal and recommend a disposition. The NCUA Board will evaluate each appeal and determine the appropriate action. The Board may request an analysis and recommendation regarding the appeal from E&amp;I, review documentation previously provided by a credit union during the application process, and/or consult with staff when reviewing an appeal. Upon determining the appropriate action, the Board will notify the field office director of its decision.</p>
        <p>The field director will send the credit union a notice indicating the NCUA Board’s decision. For a denial, the field office will send the credit union a letter indicating that the appeal has been denied (see the <a href="../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Appeal/Deny Appeal.docx">Deny Appeal</a> template). This notice must indicate the reason(s) for the denial.</p>
        <p>The field office will send the notice using the field office’s preferred expedited mail delivery, and will provide a copy to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>E&amp;I (SCMS)</li>
            <li>Field staff (district examiner, problem case officer, examiner, or specialized examiner)</li>
            <li>Field supervisor (supervisory examiner, national field supervisor, or director of special actions)</li>
            <li>Assigned RCMS or ONES CMS</li>
        </ul>
