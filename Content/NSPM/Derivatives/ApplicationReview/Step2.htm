        <h3 MadCap:autonum="A. ">Step 2:&#160;Confirm Credit Union Eligibility, Safety and Soundness (Field Office)</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Derivatives" />Within ten (10) calendar days of receiving an application for derivatives authority, the field office will determine if the applying federal credit union meets the eligibility requirements using the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Authority Qualitative Review Checklist.docx"><a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Authority Qualitative Review Checklist.docx"><a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Authority Qualitative Review Checklist.docx#appendix6ccc" target="_blank">Qualitative Review Checklist</a></a></a>. A credit union that has less than $250 million in assets (as of its most recent Call Report) must provide written documentation that a field director has granted it permission to apply (see <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=08a307da99a24051ccd8646e77eb30c4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.703_18&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§703.108 (b)</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" />).</p>
        <p>The field office will also evaluate the applying federal credit union’s safety and soundness using the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Authority Qualitative Review Checklist.docx#appendix6ccc" target="_blank"><a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Authority Qualitative Review Checklist.docx"><a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Authority Qualitative Review Checklist.docx#appendix6ccc" target="_blank">Qualitative Review Checklist</a></a></a>.</p>
        <p>If a credit union has submitted an incomplete package, the field office will send it a letter indicating which item(s) are missing from the application (see the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Respond to Incomplete Application for Derivatives Authority.docx">Respond to Incomplete Application for Derivatives Authority</a> template). </p>
        <p>If a credit union fails to meet the regulatory eligibility requirements or fails to meet the regulatory requirements for safety and soundness, the field office will deny the application and notify the credit union (see the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Deny Application for Derivatives Authority.docx">Deny Application for Derivatives Authority</a> template). This notice will indicate the specific requirement(s) the credit union failed to meet.</p>
        <p>The field director will deliver the appropriate notice using the region or ONES’s preferred expedited mail delivery, and will provide a copy to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">E&amp;I (SCMS)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Field staff (district examiner, problem case officer, examiner, or specialized examiner)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Field supervisor (supervisory examiner, national field supervisor, or director of special actions)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Assigned RCMS or ONES CMS</li>
        </ul>
