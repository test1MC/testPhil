        <h3>Step 5:&#160;Approve or Deny Application and Notify Credit Union (Field Office Director)</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Derivatives" />After evaluating the recommendation of the review panel, the field director will decide whether to approve or deny a credit union’s application for derivatives authority. The field office will try to notify a credit union of the agency’s interim and/or final approval or denial for derivatives authority within 10 calendar days of receiving a recommendation from the review panel.</p>
        <p>The field office director will send the appropriate notice listed below using the field office’s preferred expedited mail delivery, and will provide a copy to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">E&amp;I (SCMS)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Field staff (district examiner, problem case officer, examiner, or specialized examiner)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Field supervisor (supervisory examiner, national field supervisor, or director of special actions)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Assigned RCMS or ONES CMS</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>NCUA issues interim approval</h4>
        <p>The field office director will send the credit union a letter indicating that the NCUA has granted interim derivatives authority (see the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Approve Derivatives Authority (Interim).docx">Approve Derivatives Authority (Interim)</a> template). This notice must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Indicate which derivatives product(s) and/or product characteristic(s) have been approved</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Emphasize that the credit union may not enter into any derivatives transactions until it receives final written approval from an NCUA field director</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>NCUA issues final approval</h4>
        <p>The field office director will send the credit union a letter indicating that the NCUA has granted final derivatives authority (see the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Approve Derivatives Authority (Final).docx">Approve Derivatives Authority (Final)</a> template). This notice must indicate which derivatives product(s) and/or product characteristic(s) have been approved.</p>
        <h4>NCUA issues denial</h4>
        <p>The field director will send the credit union a letter indicating that the NCUA has denied the application for derivatives authority (see the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Deny Application for Derivatives Authority.docx">Deny Application for Derivatives Authority</a> template). This notice must indicate the reason(s) for the denial and inform the credit union of the option to appeal the denial directly to the NCUA Board.</p>
