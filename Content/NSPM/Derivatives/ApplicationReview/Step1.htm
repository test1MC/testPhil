            <MadCap:concept term="Derivatives" />Step 1:&#160;Log and Acknowledge the Derivatives Application (Field Office)</h3>
        <p>Upon receipt of an application for derivatives authority, the field office will create and maintain the electronic <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Information Administration Log (DIAL).docx#appendix6ZZ">Derivatives Information Administration Log (DIAL)</a> to track the application.</p>
        <p>Once an application has been logged, the field office will send a letter to the credit union to acknowledge the application. The field office will acknowledge an application for interim approval with the approved template (<a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Acknowledge Interim Application for Derivatives Authority.docx">Acknowledge Interim Application for Derivatives Authority</a>). The field will acknowledge an application for final derivatives authority using the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Acknowledge Notification of Readiness (Final Application for Derivatives Authority).docx">Acknowledge Notification of Readiness (Final Application for Derivatives Authority)</a> template. The field office will deliver the acknowledgment using the region’s or ONES preferred expedited mail delivery, and will provide a copy to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">E&amp;I (SCMS)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Field staff (district examiner, problem case officer, examiner, or specialized examiner)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Field supervisor (supervisory examiner, national field supervisor, or director of special actions)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Assigned RCMS or ONES CMS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The director of the field office will coordinate with E&amp;I to establish a derivatives application review panel, made up of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">One RCMS or ONES CMS (appointed by the field office)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">One SCMS (appointed by E&amp;I)</li>
        </ul>
