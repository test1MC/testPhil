        <h3>
            <MadCap:concept term="Derivatives" />Step 4:&#160;Review the Derivatives Application (Review Panel)</h3>
        <p>The review panel will complete its review of a credit union’s application for derivatives authority using an electronic copy of the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Authority Qualitative Review Checklist.docx">Derivatives Authority Qualitative Review Checklist</a>, which it will maintain on the derivatives SharePoint site.</p>
        <p>All reviews must be accompanied by a completed checklist that supports the panel’s recommendation to approve or deny the requested derivatives authority. At a minimum, the panel must assess all the elements required by regulation in accordance with the provisions set forth in this section. The review panel may conduct an on-site visit as a component of an application for final derivatives authority. The panel may contact the credit union directly to request additional material(s) as necessary for review.</p>
        <p>If the application is substantively incomplete, the panel is unable to contact the credit union directly, or a credit union is unable to provide requested materials, the panel will coordinate with the field office to send the credit union a notice that the application is incomplete. This notice will list the additional document(s) and/or information required to complete the material for consideration (see the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Respond to Incomplete Application for Derivatives Authority.docx">Respond to Incomplete Application for Derivatives Authority</a> template).</p>
        <p>The field office will deliver this notice using the office’s preferred expedited mail delivery, and will provide a copy to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">E&amp;I (SCMS)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Field staff (district examiner, problem case officer, examiner, or specialized examiner)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Field supervisor (supervisory examiner, national field supervisor, or director of special actions)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Assigned RCMS or ONES CMS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each panel member will document his or her review and recommendation to approve or deny the application using the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Authority Qualitative Review Checklist.docx">Derivatives Authority Qualitative Review Checklist</a>. Once completed, the panel will coordinate their joint recommendation with the field supervisor and submit it to the field office director. The field office director makes the final determination to approve or deny each application for derivatives authority, in part or in whole.</p>
        <p>The timelines for completing the review vary based on the type and complexity of the application a credit union has submitted:</p>

        <p>If the review panel determines that additional time is necessary, it will notify the field office. The field office will then provide the credit union the expected completion timeframe.&#160; Please note that these timeframes are for the NCUA’s internal planning purposes, and do not entitle a credit union to a decision by a specific date.</p>
        <p>When reviewing an application for final derivatives authority, the review panel must consider any significant changes between the credit union’s operational setup as reported in the interim application and in the final application. When a credit union submits an application for final derivatives authority without first requesting interim authority, the review panel must carefully evaluate the readiness of the credit union.</p>
