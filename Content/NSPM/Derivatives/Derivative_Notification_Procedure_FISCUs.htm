        <h2>Derivative Notification Procedures (FISCUs only)</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Derivatives" />The NCUA’s derivative rule applies specifically to federal credit unions. The process for a FISCU to receive authority to use derivatives varies by state. A FISCU may have derivatives authority under a state parity provision or by following applicable state regulation with permission from the applicable state supervisory authority. State parity provisions are reflected in state regulation or statute, and generally permit a FISCU to operate under the same authority as federally chartered credit unions.</p>
        <p>A FISCU must notify the NCUA in writing at least 30 days before it begins engaging in derivatives transactions. The <a href="../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/NCUA Notification of FISCU Derivatives Activity (FISCUs only).docx">NCUA Notification of FISCU Derivatives Activity (FISCUs only)</a> outlines the information a FISCU must report in the notification.</p>
        <p>A FISCU can submit the required notification electronically or by hard copy. The director of the applicable field office (typically the DOS) will coordinate the receipt and processing of notifications of derivatives activity received from a FISCU.</p>
        <p>The NCUA will log and track each notification it receives from a FISCU. Upon receipt, each notification will be entered into the <a href="../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Information Administration Log (DIAL).docx"><a href="../../Resources/APP-Derivatives/Derivatives Information Administration Log (DIAL).docx#appendix6ZZ">Derivatives Information Administration Log (DIAL)</a></a> and assigned a number. The official log will be maintained on SharePoint and organized separately for each field office.</p>
        <p>The information reflected in DIAL is the NCUA’s official record of the FISCUs that have notified the NCUA of their intent to engage in derivatives.</p>
