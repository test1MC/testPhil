        <h3>Division of Supervision</h3>
        <p>DOS is responsible for coordinating the examination complaint investigation with field staff. Upon receipt of an examination complaint, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">For FISCUs, review the complaint to identify if the NCUA or state made the final determination. If it was the NCUA, the complaint will be processed by DOS. If the state examiner made the final determination, the complaint will be forwarded to the state for processing.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Review the complaint and identify if it is for a material supervisory determination.<ul><li><p>DOS&#160;will ensure all actions are completed within 60 days. This includes complaints that are ultimately appealable to the committee and complaints that are not for a material supervisory determination. For matters appealable to the SRC, DOS&#160;will ensure the credit union is made aware of the response before 60 days have elapsed. </p></li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Draft and send memo to <a href="../../Resources/APP-ExamComplaints/Acknowledge Examination Complaint.docx">acknowledge the examination complaint</a> to the credit union within five days of receipt of the complaint in the regional office.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Field Staff Review</h3>
        <p>The supervisory examiner will be responsible for investigating all complaints. If the SE is named in the complaint, the associate ARDP or his/her designee may be asked, depending on the nature of the complaint, to handle the investigation.</p>
        <p>The SE (or ARDP) will contact the credit union officials and the examiner and will schedule any meetings necessary to facilitate the investigation.</p>
        <p>The SE (or ARDP) will complete the investigation and send a report to DOS outlining the investigation steps, the findings, agreements, and recommendations for action. The SE response will also include a draft <a href="../../Resources/APP-ExamComplaints/Respond to Examination Complaint (sample).docx#Appendix14B">response</a> to the credit union for the Regional Director's signature.</p>
        <p>The SE may request an extension of the investigation timeframe for any complaint not governed by IRPS 11-1, <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Documents/IRPS/IRPS2011-1.pdf" target="_blank">Supervisory Review Committee</a>, as amended by IRPS 12-1, by sending an e-mail request to the ARDP explaining the reason for the extension.
