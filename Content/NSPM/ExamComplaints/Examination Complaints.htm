            <MadCap:concept term="ExamComplaints" />Examination Complaints</h1>
        <p>Credit union officials have the right to appeal or file a complaint on examination issues directly to the Regional Director. This would include any written or informal appeal or complaint related to an examination or supervision contact or other supervisory determination and may take the form of complaints against supervisory examiners, examiners, requests for a different examiner, or requests for some type of change to the examination report.</p>
        <p>In addition, Part 309 of the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;frm=1&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDwQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gpo.gov%2Ffdsys%2Fpkg%2FSTATUTE-108%2Fpdf%2FSTATUTE-108-Pg2160.pdf&amp;ei=zetsU-HgOOeqsQS1qoCoCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNG1KlPq17jHWATvCauGVkj7_4cEpg&amp;sig2=N2tRteFX7DbT7-YvydpUmQ&amp;bvm=bv.66111022,d.cWc" target="_blank">Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994</a> required the NCUA to establish an independent appellate process to review material supervisory determinations. In 2017, the NCUA Board approved a final rule (<a href="https://www.ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/Documents/Regulations/final-rule-src-appeals-2017-oct.pdf" target="_blank">Part 746, Subpart A</a>) outlining the review process. After making a request for reconsideration from the Regional Director, a credit union may request a review by the Office of Examination and Insurance or appeal directly to the Supervisory Review Committee. A credit union may also file an appeal with the NCUA Board challenging the decision by the Supervisory Review Committee.</p>
        <p>Examination material supervisory determination is defined as written decisions by a program office that may significantly affect the capital, earnings, operating flexibility, or that may otherwise affect the nature or level of supervisory oversight of a credit union. The term includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Composite CAMEL ratings of 3, 4, and 5 and all component ratings of those composite ratings</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Adequacy of loan loss reserve provisions</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Loan classifications on loans that are significant as determined by the appealing credit union</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To be appealable to the committee, an examination complaint must be filed by a credit union within 30 days of the Regional Office’s final determination or the final determination of the Office of Examination and Insurance, if applicable. A complaint regarding a FISCU examination may be made to the NCUA if the final determination was made by the NCUA examiner. If a final determination was made by the state examiner, the NCUA&#160;will turn the complaint over to the state for the appropriate action.</p>
