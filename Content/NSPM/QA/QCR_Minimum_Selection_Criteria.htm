            <p>Each region’s DOS will perform QCRs on any examinations meeting the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">All credit unions coded CAMEL 3 with assets greater than $100 million</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">All credit unions coded CAMEL 3 for longer than 36 months and with assets greater than $50 million</li>

                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">All credit unions with assets greater than $250 million</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition, each region’s DOS will perform QCRs on any examination or follow-up examination when a credit union is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Issued a published LUA</li>
                <li>Subject to an immediate and/or permanent cease and desist order</li>
                <li>Subject to a prompt corrective action, not including an earnings transfer waiver</li>
                <li>In conservatorship</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Federally Insured, State-Chartered Credit Union Quality Control Selection</h3>
            <p>Each region’s DOS will perform QCRs on any examinations meeting the following criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All FISCUs that meet the criteria above, including both joint examinations or independent insurance reviews</li>
                <li>FISCU QCRs will be based upon the lower of the SSA’s or the NCUA’s CAMEL ratings</li>
                <li>FISCU QCRs will encompass review of all insurance risks including both the NCUA and SSA’s WCC 11s and the corresponding NCUA WCC 26</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Offsite Supervision Quality Control</h3>
            <p>Each quarter, each region’s DOS will select a five percent sample of risk reviews (RATE Reviews) completed by field staff and conduct a quality control review. These reviews, documented for regional management, will evaluate whether field staff’s analysis of risk trends and recommended supervision plans are appropriate.</p>
            <h3>Additional Discretionary Reviews</h3>
            <p>In addition to the examination review criteria listed above, each region will further evaluate the effectiveness of its examination and supervision program by selecting additional examination and supervision contacts for Quality Control Reviews through the use of judgmental sampling. The sampling criteria may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>FICU follow-up exams or supervision contacts (evaluate effectiveness of problem resolution)</li>
