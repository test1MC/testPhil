            <h4>Supervisor Evaluations</h4>
            <p>Supervisors are responsible for regularly reviewing completed examinations and assessing the examiner performance.  Supervisor evaluations are intended to be both a learning tool and feedback mechanism for the examiner and supervisor. There are three types of supervisor evaluations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Full Review</li>
                <li>Scanned Review</li>
                <li>Documented Secondary CAMEL Review (DSCR)</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Full Review</h5>
            <p>A Full Review is the most comprehensive review a supervisor will perform and reflects an in-depth review of the examiner’s identification of risk and problem areas, as well as the appropriateness and effectiveness of plans for corrective action.</p>
            <p class="ShadedBox">SEs are expected to import the examination zip file into AIRES to evaluate the quality of the report and ensure the DOR module and other required elements are used properly.</p>
            <p>When completing a Full Review on a state report review, supervisors will use the SSR form type. A Full Review of a state report will include a review of the <b>NCUA WCC 26</b>, the <b>state regulator WCC 11</b>, and the <b>NCUA WCC 11</b>, as applicable. Full Reviews of state examinations should not take place until the state regulator examination has been uploaded and the WCC 26 review completed by the NCUA examiner.</p>
            <p>Supervisors will use the following minimum evaluation requirements to select reports for a Full Review:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All reports from examiners who are in probationary status (employed by the NCUA less than one year)<ul><li>These reviews will be conducted independently of the on-the-job trainer</li></ul></li>
                <li>A minimum of five (or all if less) regular FCU examinations (WCC 10), FISCU insurance review (WCC 11), or follow-up FCU/FISCU  contacts (WCC 22/WCC 23) for each examiner with less than two years’ experience</li>
                <li>Each examiner must receive a minimum of three Full Reviews, excluding WCC 26 state report reviews (or all, if fewer than three reports are available to review)<ul><li>These reviews will be documented on the Supervisor Evaluation Form</li></ul></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additional reviews will be necessary when a supervisor identifies a developmental need. Supervisors should strive to complete reviews evenly over the calendar year.</p>
            <p> Full Reviews will be completed within 45 days of upload of the examination, and should be sent to the examiner, DOS, and the ARDP by email. Supervisors and examiners review and discuss written report reviews with each other as needed to resolve issues or concerns addressed in a written review.</p>
            <h5>Scanned Review</h5>
            <p>Scanned Reviews require the supervisor to conduct, at a minimum, a cursory review of key ratios, the Examination Overview, Document of Resolution, and Confidential Section. The judgment of the supervisor will determine the depth of further review necessary (i.e., discussion with the examiner, accessing and reviewing report work papers, etc.). Scanned Reviews will be completed for all credit unions exceeding $100 million in assets not subject to Full Reviews or Documented Secondary CAMEL Reviews.</p>
            <p>Supervisors and examiners review and discuss Scanned Reviews with each other as needed to resolve issues or concerns.</p>
            <h5>Documented Secondary CAMEL Review</h5>
            <p>A Documented Secondary CAMEL Review is part of the quality assurance process. The NSPM&#160;outlines the <a href="../DistrictMgmt/08-AdministrativeItems/DSCR.htm">responsibilities of the examiner and supervisor surrounding Documented Secondary CAMEL&#160;Reviews</a> and establishes when these must be completed.</p>
            <p>These reviews must be shared with the examiner. Supervisors and examiners review and discuss Documented Secondary CAMEL&#160;Reviews with each other as needed to resolve issues or concerns.</p>
            <h4>Supervisor Evaluation Forms Overview</h4>
            <p>Scanned Reviews and Full Reviews will be completed within 45 days of upload of the examination.</p>
