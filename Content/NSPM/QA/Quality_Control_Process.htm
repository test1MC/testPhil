            <h2 MadCap:autonum="1. ">Quality Control Process</h2>
            <p>The primary quality assurance process for the examination and supervision functions consists of a Quality Control Review (QCR). The QCR form, along with the Supervisor Evaluation Form, are the agency’s tools designed to evaluate whether an individual examination or supervision contact report meets national standards, provide a written assessment of the report, and assess the adequacy of ongoing supervision. The QCR form and Supervisor Evaluation Form are intended to be both a learning tool and feedback mechanism for the examiner and supervisor. The evaluation and rating of field staff performance remains the responsibility of the supervisor.</p>
            <p>E&amp;I will establish (with regional input), from time to time, the specific contents of the QCR form for each type of examination and supervision contact. The scope of each review may vary in accordance with the type of contact or targeted review objective.</p>
            <p>To ensure a consistent risk-focused approach is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the supervision program, the agency will use a national QCR database. The database contains the examination and supervision review forms in addition to the Risk Reviews, and the Supervisor Evaluation Form.<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> Until these tools are completed, regions will continue to use their existing QCR processes until the NSPM system is fully functional. However, regions should use NSPM QCR selection criteria as of the NSPM’s implementation date. </p></MadCap:footnote></p>
            <p>Any examination, follow-up examination, or supervision contact can be selected for a quality control review at the discretion of management.</p>
