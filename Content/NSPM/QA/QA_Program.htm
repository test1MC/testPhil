            <h1>Quality Assurance Program</h1>
            <p>The NCUA’s Quality Assurance program includes the assessment and review of all activities relating to the oversight of FICUs. This section of the NSPM&#160;will cover the quality assurance processes used to carry out the agency’s safety and soundness mission. The NCUA’s quality assurance objectives are to evaluate whether the agency’s supervision program complies with national requirements and that national requirements keep pace with the ever-changing risks inherent in or introduced into the credit union industry.</p>
            <p>This section of the NSPM&#160;describes the quality assurance program and the quality control report processes supervisors and the regional DOS use to evaluate and review FCU and FISCU examination reports and supervision work.</p>
