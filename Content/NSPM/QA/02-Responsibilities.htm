            </ul>
            <h3>Supervisor Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>Supervisors are responsible for reviewing and evaluating reports, and for providing consistent and timely feedback regarding the quality of the work and suggestions for improving performance with an emphasis on identification of significant problems and timely and effective resolution of significant problems.</p>
            <p>The supervisor will complete a Scanned Review, a Documented Secondary CAMEL Review, or a Full Review of all examinations, insurance reviews, supervision contact reports, and state report reviews completed by examiners in their supervisory group per the <a href="Supervisor_Responsibilities.htm">criteria provided in the NSPM</a>:</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <h3>Field Staff Responsibilities</h3>

            </ul>
            <p>Examiners should discuss their concerns with issues raised in a QCR with their supervisor to determine a course of action (this may include a response memo addressing disagreements with the QCR as discussed in the QCR Appeal Process section of the NSPM).</p>
