            <h2>Examination and Supervision Program Review Process</h2>
            <h3>QCR Preparation and Distribution</h3>
            <p>DOS uses AIRES, including the Scope module, Risk Reports, FICU file, and any other relevant data to evaluate the report; see chapter 22 of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/ExaminersGuide.flsnp" />. QCRs must be completed within 45 days of upload of the examination.</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A supervision analyst evaluates the report and prepares a QCR Form, including any recommended subsequent actions.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the report contains no material issues, the director of supervision (DDOS)<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> For purposes of the QCR requirement, formal DDOS responsibilities may be delegated to the deputy director DOS at each region’s discretion.</p></MadCap:footnote> reviews and signs off on the QCR Form.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the report contains material issues and/or is substandard, DOS will take the following actions:<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Analyst will discuss the material issues or substandard elements with the DDOS</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the DDOS concurs with the issues or elements, they will determine the type of action most appropriate (for example, memo, email, etc.) and proceed accordingly</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Analyst will notate the type of deficiency within the QCR form, the type of action taken, and the date a response is due from the supervisor (if applicable)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Flag the QCR form for follow-up, as appropriate</li></ul></li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">DOS distributes the completed QCR Forms to the EIC and supervisor simultaneously via email on a flow basis to regional management.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When possible, DOS will provide informal advanced notice of any memo to the supervisor prior to sending the QCR to the examiner and supervisor.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Supervisors will review all QCR forms and associated memos (if applicable) and discuss with the examiner (if necessary).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="ShadedBox">Analysts are expected to import the examination zip file into AIRES to evaluate the quality of the report and ensure the DOR module and other required elements are used properly. </p>
            <h3>QCR Corrections and Reconsiderations</h3>
            <p class="ShadedBox">A request to correct or reconsider a QCR must be submitted within 30 days of the completion of a QCR form, and must be discussed with the DDOS before being submitted for consideration. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If an examiner substantially disagrees with significant issues noted in a QCR form, the examiner should discuss the issues with their supervisor.</li>
                <li>If the supervisor agrees with the examiner’s position and the concerns are determined to be material, the supervisor first discusses the issues with the DDOS.</li>
                <li>The DDOS will review the request and any supporting documentation provided, as well as the examination report (if necessary) to reassess the QCR form. The DDOS is responsible for revising the form, if appropriate.<ul><li>DDOS&#160;must approve or deny a request within 30 days of receipt.</li><li>If the DDOS&#160;denies a request to correct a QCR form, the DDOS&#160;will prepare a response to the SE and copy the ARDP, ARDO, and RD.</li></ul></li>
                <li>If a solution is not reached between the supervisor and DDOS, the examiner will draft a memo to their supervisor outlining the reasons for the disagreement, including any supporting documentation. The supervisor will forward the memo, with their comments, to DDOS with a copy to the ARDP and ARDO.</li>
                <li>DOS reviews the supervisor’s memo, documentation, and the examination report to reassess the QCR and revises the QCR Form if appropriate. Absent revision to the QCR Form, DOS prepares a response to the supervisor for the Regional Director’s signature.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="ShadedBox">Supervisors can also initiate a correction or reconsideration of a QCR if they disagree with DOS’ comments by contacting DDOS. </p>
