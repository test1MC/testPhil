            <MadCap:concept term="ExamComplaints" />Examination Reports</h1>
        <p>Examiners will write reports and prepare documents in accordance with the <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Human Resources/Communication Manual/NCUA Communications Manual (12-2014).pdf#search=NCUA Communications Manual" target="_blank">NCUA Communications Manual</a> and plain writing guidelines. Examiners must develop a professional and concise examination report that communicates all problems and risks in an easy to read and understandable format for the credit union officials.</p>
        <p>The examination report must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Properly identify all material examination concerns related to the seven risk areas (credit, interest rate, liquidity, transaction, compliance, strategic, and reputation risk)</li>
            <li>Relate the applicable risk areas to the CAMEL ratings</li>
            <li>Support all conclusions reached regarding problems identified</li>
            <li>Outline proper corrective actions to ensure problems are resolved in a timely manner</li>
            <li>Establish a documented administrative record to support future administrative action and problem resolution, if necessary</li>
            <li>Be properly supported by <a href="../DistrictMgmt/08-AdministrativeItems/AIRES-RequiredWorkpapers.htm">required documentation</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ShadedBox">For more information about the components of an examination report, see the Exam Report Writing section of the Examiner’s Guide.</p>
        <p>Examiners should set aside time throughout an exam to discuss problems identified during the contact with management and officials. It is important to provide management a draft copy of the Document of Resolution, Examiner’s Findings, and Loan Exceptions with sufficient time to review before the joint conference or exit meeting. Examiners should not present new information to managers at the joint conference, exit meeting, or in the examination report.</p>
        <p>Examiners will use the AIRES Table of Contents to organize examination reports and document the official report components and workpapers given to the officials. Examiners will provide the credit union copies of the Examination Cover Letter, Examination Overview, and other report documents as applicable.</p>
        <p>Examiners may informally provide a credit union any schedules, optional workpapers, questionnaires, or examiner-designed workpapers necessary to support their conclusions and assist in gaining resolution to problems uncovered during the exam or supervision process. However, only those workpapers and documents listed in the Table of Contents are considered part of the official examination report given to officials.</p>
