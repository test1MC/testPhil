        <h3>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />Joint Examinations (WCC 11)</h3>
        <p>The state examiner is the EIC for joint examinations unless otherwise agreed to by the SSA. NCUA examiners have the responsibility to ensure WCC 11 exams meet the scope guidelines specified in the most recent <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Instruction5000.flsnp" />. In the Scope module, the NCUA EIC will note which scope steps the SSA performed. The NCUA EIC will ensure appropriate completion of the scope steps (as they would for any team member). If the work is adequate, the NCUA EIC can accept the work.</p>
        <p>If the SSA does not use AIRES and/or the examiner feels the scope will not be adequately completed by the SSA, the NCUA EIC will note this in their scope and document the SSA’s work to the best of their ability (including possibly using the team merge function in AIRES to get the SSA’s exam scope into the NCUA AIRES upload).</p>
        <p>The NCUA will make every effort to schedule joint examinations with the SSA in order to streamline the process and facilitate networking and cooperation between the two agencies. If the NCUA and the SSA cannot schedule a joint examination, the NCUA will conduct an insurance review. When a joint exam was not possible, the EIC will note the reason(s), and the efforts made to coordinate a joint examination with the SSA, in the Confidential Section.  When a joint exam was conducted, the EIC will note the extent of SSA participation.</p>
        <h4>Joint Examination Documentation</h4>
        <p>For joint examinations, the final examination report will usually be a joint report, which encompasses both NCUA and SSA recommendations. If necessary, the NCUA may issue an independent report. The NCUA will notify the SSA of plans to issue a separate report prior to issuance to the FISCU.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">NCUA examiners and SSA examiners can upload a scope workbook for a WCC 11 to AIRES with the same effective date.<br />For joint examinations, NCUA examiners should exclude problem codes and violations from the WCC 11 upload via the Data Communications section, Send Exam tab of AIRES. NCUA examiners will review whether the state included the problem codes and violations and add any missing problem codes or violations as part of the WCC 26 Review <a href="../05-Review_State_Exam.htm">as outlined in the NSPM</a>.</p>
        <p>NCUA examiners must upload their own WCC 11 examination report to document the work performed by the NCUA. The WCC 11 upload also serves to identify any discrepancies between information provided to the SSA for inclusion in the joint report. For WCC 11 Joint Examinations, NCUA examiners need to upload:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">NCUA-developed standard examination documents provided to the SSA such as Overview commentary, DOR document, and Examiner’s Findings</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Joint Conferences</h4>
        <p>If the SSA plans to hold a joint conference, the NCUA examiner will attend and participate in the meeting. If the SSA does not plan to hold a joint conference, the NCUA examiner must hold a joint conference for all CAMEL 3, 4, and 5 credit unions. In the event a quorum is not present, examiners will instruct the credit union’s management to note it in the board minutes and provide documentation to the examiner regarding whether management adopted the DOR at a subsequent meeting. NCUA examiners will notify their supervisor of the date and time of the joint conference at least three business days in advance of holding the joint conference. The NCUA supervisor will notify the SSA staff of the date of the joint conference and invite them to participate.</p>
