        <h3>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />Insurance Reviews (WCC 11)</h3>
        <p>The NCUA examiner is the EIC for all insurance reviews. As such, it is the NCUA’s responsibility to ensure completion of the AIRES examination procedures and work papers.</p>
        <p>The scope of an insurance review will focus on concerns with safety and soundness. Examiners will complete the examination scope steps (detailed in the most recent <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Instruction5000.flsnp" />), concentrating on areas of risk, including compliance with <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> and other regulations that may represent a risk to the share insurance fund if the credit union failed to comply (see chapter 26 of the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/GuidesEtc/Pages/Examiners-Guide.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/ExaminersGuide.flsnp" /></a>).</p>
        <h4>Insurance Review Documentation</h4>
        <p>At a minimum, documentation of an insurance review will include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Completed Scope module</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Indication of compliance or non-compliance with previous <a href="../../AdminRemedies/03-DOR/DOR.htm">DOR</a>, <a href="../../AdminRemedies/05-LUA/LUA.htm">LUA</a>, NWRP/RBP items or agreements relating to safety and soundness</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Completed DOR module in AIRES, if applicable</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Consumer Compliance Violations module in AIRES, if applicable</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Status and management’s acceptance of current DOR</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Completed Confidential Section</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Written narrative report provided to credit union and SSA</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Joint Conferences</h4>
        <p>NCUA examiners must hold a joint conference for all CAMEL 3, 4, and 5s. In the event a quorum is not present, examiners will instruct the credit union’s management to note it in the board minutes and provide documentation to the examiner regarding whether management adopted the DOR at a subsequent meeting. NCUA examiners will notify their supervisor of the date and time of the joint conference at least three business days in advance of holding the joint conference. The NCUA supervisor will notify the SSA staff of the date of the joint conference and invite them to participate.</p>
        <p>If requested, the NCUA EIC will provide a copy of examination work papers outlining corrective actions and any related handouts to the SSA prior to meeting with credit union officials with the goal of allowing sufficient time for SSA review and feedback prior to the meeting. As a courtesy, the SSA should also have an opportunity to review the finalized complete insurance review report prior to issuance to the credit union. However, issuance of the report is at the NCUA’s discretion.</p>
