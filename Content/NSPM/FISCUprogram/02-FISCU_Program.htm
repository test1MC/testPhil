        <h2>NCUA FISCU Program</h2>
        <h3>Disclosing NCUA CAMEL and Risk Ratings </h3>
        <p>Examiners will strive to disclose the NCUA CAMEL simultaneously with disclosure by the SSA, but in no event later than the final meeting with management and officials.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"> A final meeting is the last on-site meeting with the credit union and the NCUA present. In some cases, this will be the same as the exit meeting or the joint conference.</p>
        <p>The NCUA CAMEL and supporting rationale will be documented using the FISCU CAMEL Disclosure form in AIRES. The NCUA EIC will clearly identify the conditions supporting the individual CAMEL component ratings and CAMEL composite rating.</p>
        <p>The examiner will use and deliver to the credit union the following AIRES forms (at a minimum) to document the CAMEL disclosure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Region X –FISCUCAMELCoverLetter.doc</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Table of Contents</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />CAMEL-Disclosure in FISCUs (in exam.xls)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For CAMEL composite 1 or 2 FISCUs requiring a <a href="../DistrictMgmt/08-AdministrativeItems/DSCR.htm">Documented Secondary CAMEL Review</a>, the examiner, in consultation with their SE, may determine that sending the FISCU CAMEL Disclosure form via secured email or post with a teleconference to discuss the contents of the form is appropriate based on the concerns (or lack thereof) noted during the examination. This gives examiners and SEs sufficient time to review the CAMEL and risk ratings as required. The SSA will be invited to participate on the teleconference. </p>
        <p>For CAMEL composite 3, 4, or 5 FISCUs, a joint conference is required to deliver the NCUA CAMEL. NCUA examiners may have to schedule a joint conference to disclose the NCUA CAMEL rating that provides time for their SE to perform a Documented Secondary CAMEL Review if the Documented Secondary CAMEL Review cannot be completed prior to the SSA’s joint conference. The SSA will be invited to participate at the NCUA CAMEL disclosure joint conference.</p>
        <p>For SSAs that have added an “S” to CAMEL(S) to record the credit union’s interest rate risk sensitivity position, examiners will record the lower (worse) of the “L” or “S” rating in the AIRES CAMEL “L” field unless, in their professional judgment, the rating should be different. For example, if the “L” is rated a code 2 and the “S” is rated code 3, examiners will typically record a code 3 in the “L” field. Examiners will take into account the impact of the credit union’s liquidity and interest rate sensitivity position on the overall health of the institution when assigning the rating.</p>
        <h4>Joint FISCU Examinations/Contacts</h4>
        <h5>Field Staff Responsibilities</h5>
        <p>The NCUA EIC will assign component and composite CAMEL ratings during joint contacts based on the work and conclusions reached by both the SSA and NCUA examiners. For WCC 11 and WCC 23 contacts, NCUA examiners will do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Work cooperatively with the SSA examiner in charge and maintain ongoing communications during the examination, which will include a meeting to discuss differences in CAMEL rating conclusions and attempts to resolve any component or composite differences with the SSA.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">In the event a component or composite rating differs from the respective SSA rating, and the EIC is unable to reach agreement with the SSA, the NCUA EIC will notify their NCUA supervisor and seek concurrence for their CAMEL ratings.<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Once the NCUA supervisor has concurred with the CAMEL ratings, the examiner will proceed to disclose the NCUA’s CAMEL as outlined above.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the SSA does not disclose a CAMEL rating either onsite, or if done later than the final meeting, the NCUA will still disclose its rating as outlined above.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">In situations where the NCUA EIC issues a different component or composite CAMEL rating than the SSA, the EIC will document efforts to reach agreement with the SSA on the CAMEL rating in the NCUA Confidential Section.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <h5>NCUA Supervisor Responsibilities</h5>
        </p>
        <p>The NCUA supervisor is responsible for ensuring the NCUA EIC supports the CAMEL rating and communicates actively with their SSA counterpart(s) to resolve differences. For WCC 11 and WCC 23 contacts, NCUA supervisors will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Review supporting information with in-process examinations to provide concurrence for CAMEL ratings assigned to the FISCU when issuing a differing CAMEL rating</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Communicate with the SSA in advance to notify the SSA supervisory staff that the NCUA has a differing CAMEL rating when the NCUA and SSA EIC cannot agree on a consistent CAMEL rating</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prioritize performing Documented Secondary Reviews of CAMEL for FISCUs in order to allow for the expeditious disclosure of NCUA CAMEL ratings to FISCUs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <h5>Regional Office Responsibilities</h5>
        </p>
        <p>The regional office is responsible for facilitating open communication with the SSAs and completing quality control over the assigned ratings.</p>
        <h4>CAMEL Differences during WCC 26 Reviews</h4>
        <p>This procedure applies to WCC 26 reviews where the NCUA examiner did not participate onsite during the examination and has not previously disclosed CAMEL to the FISCU as outlined above. As discussed in the NSPM, NCUA examiners evaluate CAMEL when performing WCC 26 reviews of state examinations. For WCC 26 reviews, the following apply: </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When the examiner performing the WCC 26 review assigns the same rating as the SSA composite rating, no additional action is needed; unless, the composite rating is a 4 or 5. For newly downgraded CAMEL 4 or 5 FISCUs, the NCUA examiner must verify whether the FISCU was given notice of its troubled condition <a href="../DistrictMgmt/06-Notice_of_Troubled_Condition.htm">as outlined in the NSPM</a>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When the NCUA examiner assigns a different composite rating, but chooses to rate the credit union a composite CAMEL 1 or 2, no further action is needed.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When the NCUA examiner’s rating differs from the SSA composite rating and a composite CAMEL 3 is assigned by the NCUA, the examiner, in concurrence with their SE, will determine the best course of action to more fully evaluate material risks. This may include obtaining, through the SE, additional examination information from the SSA before completing the WCC 26 contact or scheduling an onsite contact, as appropriate.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When the NCUA examiner’s rating differs from the SSA composite rating and a composite CAMEL 4 or 5 is assigned by the NCUA, the examiner will schedule an onsite review sufficient to more fully evaluate material risks. The examiner may obtain, through their supervisory examiner, additional examination information from the SSA to more fully evaluate risks before completing the WCC 26 contact or scheduling an onsite contact, as appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ShadedBox">See the <a href="04-Supervision_Contacts/Review_SSA_Exam.htm">Reviews of SSA&#160;Examinations</a> section of the NSPM&#160;for timeframes for completing the subsequent onsite contact. A credit union is not considered in troubled condition based on an NCUA CAMEL rating until an onsite contact is performed.<br /><br />For more information about troubled credit unions, see the <a href="../DistrictMgmt/06-Notice_of_Troubled_Condition.htm">Notice of Troubled Credit Union</a> section of the NSPM. </p>
        <h5>Field Staff Responsibilities</h5>
        <p>The following process is used for WCC 26 reviews when the examiner assigns a CAMEL composite rating of 3, 4 or 5 which differs from the SSA assigned rating:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The NCUA examiner will obtain supervisor concurrence for CAMEL differences with the SSA where the NCUA issues a composite CAMEL 3, 4, or 5 rating.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The NCUA examiner will work through their supervisor to schedule an insurance review or on-site supervision contact within the appropriate period of time, <a href="04-Supervision_Contacts/Review_SSA_Exam.htm">as outlined in the NSPM</a>.<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">The purpose of the requested insurance review or on-site supervision contact will be to evaluate risk and reach conclusions on the appropriate CAMEL rating, as well as agreements for corrective action with credit union management.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h5>NCUA Supervisor Responsibilities</h5>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Supervisors will assist the examiner in obtaining more information on material issues within an examination report as needed.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Supervisors will follow up with the SSA to ensure insurance reviews or on-site supervision contacts are scheduled within a reasonable timeframe.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Regional Office Responsibilities</h5>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The regional office is responsible for facilitating open communication with the SSAs to discuss differences in CAMEL identified during WCC 26 reviews. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">ARDPs will decide whether NCUA examiners will perform a contact without SSA participation if joint contacts cannot be scheduled within a reasonable period of time. Documented ARDP approval is needed if a joint contact cannot be scheduled within a reasonable timeframe and the NCUA does not perform its own insurance review or on-site supervision contact. </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>E&amp;I Responsibilities </h5>
        <p>E&amp;I will monitor national and regional trends with respect to differences in CAMEL ratings and summarize the frequency and magnitude of CAMEL differences within regions and selected states no less than annually. The goal for such reviews is to ensure the consistent application of CAMEL, especially in instances when an NCUA CAMEL differs from the SSA CAMEL.</p>
