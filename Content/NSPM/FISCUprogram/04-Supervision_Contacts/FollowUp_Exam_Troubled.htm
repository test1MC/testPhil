        <h3>Follow-Up Examinations for a Troubled/Problem FISCU (WCC 23)</h3>
        <p>Follow-up examinations are more comprehensive than other onsite supervision contacts and require an analysis of data to support the CAMEL ratings and administrative action recommendations.</p>
        <h4>Follow-Up Examination Timeframes</h4>
        <p>At a minimum, examiners will perform a follow-up examination, which must include a joint conference with the board of directors, when the credit union is a:</p>

        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />In FISCUs that have less than $250 million in assets, the Regional Director has authority to determine the risk priority needs of a follow-up examination and establish an alternate schedule based on regional risk priorities and impact to the share insurance fund.</p>
        <h4>Timeframe Exceptions for Follow-Up Examinations</h4>
        <p>Examiners will consult their supervisor and request an extension via email if they cannot complete a follow-up examination within the required timeframe. The guidelines for requesting an extension are:</p>

        </table>
        <p>Any approvals to exceed the timeframes listed above require the supervisor or ARDP, as applicable, to forward their approval via email to DOS with supporting documentation. All time frame extension approvals will include a projected completion date.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">The basis for tracking the above timeframes will be the NCUA examination completion date for NCUA onsite participation (joint).</p>
        <p>Each region will establish monitoring procedures for FISCU follow-up examinations and timeframe extensions similar to what is required for supervision of FCUs. The ARDP will review the applicable report(s) and share them with their supervisors to evaluate appropriateness and timeliness of completion contacts to ensure a quality and timely supervision program.</p>
        <h4>Follow-Up Examination Documentation</h4>
        <p>Examiners will support in the scope, or by other means that can be part of the administrative record, all of the critical problem areas identified during the regular examination. Before uploading an AIRES contact, examiners will indicate on the AIRES Exam Management Console (EMC) whether the supervision contact was a follow-up examination (yes/no button on the Completion Information tab in AIRES). Examiners need to upload a completed Scope module and sufficient AIRES work papers to support the scope of the review and conclusions.</p>
        <p>The administrative record for FISCUs also needs to be comparable to FCUs, including maintenance of a Supervision Chronology Report<![CDATA[  ]]><a href="../../DistrictMgmt/02-General_Responsibilities.htm">as detailed in the NSPM</a>.</p>
        <p>All follow-up examinations will include a report to the FISCU. The final report may either be a joint report with the SSA or a stand-alone NCUA report. NCUA examiners must upload their own WCC 23 report to document the work performed by the NCUA. The WCC 23 upload also serves to identify any discrepancies between information provided to the SSA for inclusion in the joint report. For WCC 23 follow-up examinations, examiners need to upload:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">AIRES historical download, Exam.xls, and all critical input areas</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Sections in the Scope module that were the subject of the follow-up examination, including pertinent risk ratings<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Examiners will document their explanations of any change of final risk ratings in the Scope module.

        <p>When the SSA issues the report to the credit union, the NCUA EIC will work with the SSA to ensure the report includes required corrective actions, administrative actions, and provide relevant supporting sections of the report to the officials during the joint conference (for example, DOR, Examiner’s Findings, and other appropriate work papers such as the Supplementary Facts). The NCUA EIC will follow up to ensure the SSA issues the report timely. In the event the SSA does not issue a report as previously agreed or if the report is not timely, the NCUA EIC will notify their supervisor and plan to issue their own report (as discussed in the paragraph below).</p>
        <p>When the NCUA issues the report to the credit union, the NCUA EIC will <a href="../../DistrictMgmt/08-AdministrativeItems/Deliver_Report_CU_Officials.htm">deliver the report as they would an examination report</a>. Examiners must discuss required corrective actions, administrative actions, and provide relevant supporting sections of the report with the officials during the joint conference (for example, DOR, Examiner’s Findings, and other appropriate work papers such as the Supplementary Facts).</p>
