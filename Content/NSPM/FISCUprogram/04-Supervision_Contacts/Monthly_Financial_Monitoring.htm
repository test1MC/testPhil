            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />Monthly Financial Monitoring (WCC 28)</h3>
        <p>Examiners must trend monthly financial data for the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any CAMEL 4 or 5 credit union with more than $250M in assets</li>
            <li>Any CAMEL 3 credit union with more than $1B in assets</li>
            <li>All cases assigned to the Division of Special Actions</li>
            <li>All troubled institutions in which financial condition is a concern and the credit union represents significant risk to the share insurance fund (as in the case of a large, troubled institution)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Examiners must trend the data using SATEX or an equivalent tool. Examiners will charge this type of offsite supervision to <a href="Offsite_Supervision_Contacts.htm">WCC 28</a> and will upload a Minimal Contact.</p>
        <p>Examiners will make every effort to receive monthly financials directly from the credit union. For example, a section of the DOR could request financial and/or board packets be sent on a monthly basis to the respective SSA and NCUA examiner. If the examiner does not receive monthly financials directly from the credit union, their supervisor will on a case-by-case basis:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Work with the SSA office to determine the method for the NCUA examiner to obtain the monthly financial information needed and means for follow-up on requested reports</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Notify the SSA and/or FISCU when there is a change in district assignment or the monthly financial data is no longer needed</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine the format of the examiner’s analysis and reporting requirements</li>
        </ul>
