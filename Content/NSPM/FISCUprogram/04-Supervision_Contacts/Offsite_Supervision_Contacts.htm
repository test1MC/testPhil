        <h3>Offsite Supervision Contacts (WCC 28)</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />Offsite supervision of FISCUs may be necessary in a variety of situations. Examiners conduct offsite supervision somewhere other than at the credit union. Offsite supervision of FISCUs may entail review of SSA supervision contacts completed between examinations (we asked the SSAs to supply the regional office copies of reports for any follow-up or supervision contacts. The regional office will send the district examiner a copy of all reports and correspondence received). Offsite supervision may also be necessary to perform a more detailed review of financial statements or progress in resolving outstanding issues from a prior examination that do not warrant onsite supervision. Additional examples of FISCU offsite supervision include reviews/monitoring of CAMEL 4/5 FISCUs, FISCUs with outstanding LUAs or NWRPs, and large CAMEL 3 FISCUs with strategic and/or financial concerns. The timing and scope of offsite supervision is at the discretion of examiners and their supervisor.</p>
        <p>Examiners will not change a credit union’s composite CAMEL rating during a WCC 28 unless the WCC 28 is a review of an SSA onsite contact. When a WCC 28 is used to review an SSA onsite contact, examiners should follow the guidelines outlined under WCC 26 Reviews regarding disagreements in CAMEL and notification of troubled condition as outlined in various sections of this section of the NSPM.</p>
        <h4>Documentation Requirements for Offsite Contacts Eight Hours or More</h4>
        <p>A <a href="../../DistrictMgmt/08-AdministrativeItems/AIRES-MinimalUpload.htm">minimal AIRES upload</a> or a “minimal contact” is required for all WCC 28 offsite contacts of eight hours or more. Examiners document an offsite supervision contact of eight hours or more by uploading a “Minimal Contact” report in AIRES and charging time to WCC 28. At a minimum, the AIRES upload must include a completed EMC that documents the contact scope, progress, conclusions, recommendations, etc. in either the “Examiner Comments” section on the Completion Information tab of the EMC or in the Executive Summary, Status Update or Supplementary Facts.</p>
        <p>An AIRES upload with a completed Scope module for offsite supervision is only required for a material change in risk ratings. Otherwise, the Scope module is optional.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">Minimal uploads don't include Word and Excel files. To include these types of files in an upload, you must bypass the "minimal upload."<br /></p>
        <h4>Documentation Requirements for Offsite Contacts Less Than Eight Hours</h4>
        <p>Examiners will aggregate time spent performing offsite supervision in increments less than eight hours for the same credit union and upload to AIRES on a quarterly basis. If the aggregate time charged in a quarter is less than eight hours, an AIRES upload is not required.</p>

            <p>This does not apply to contacts for credit unions with BSA violations that must be resolved by a specific date. Examiners will complete an AIRES upload for BSA-related resolution contacts. For more information about BSA enforcement, see the <a href="../../BSAenforcement/BSA_Enforcement.htm">BSA Enforcement</a> section of the NSPM.</p>
