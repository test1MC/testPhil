        <h3>Reviews of SSA Examinations (WCC 26)</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />SSAs upload AIRES examinations in a similar fashion as NCUA examiners. When the NCUA receives an SSA examination report (typically through AIRES) and a corresponding Scope module (except from the non-participating states), examiners typically have three hours to review the SSA report. Examiners typically refer to this type of offsite supervision contact as a code 26 review, because they charge time spent to WCC 26. In essence, a WCC&#160;26 review is the time an examiner spends to identify financial and operational risks in FISCUs. </p>
        <p>Reviews of independent SSA examinations resulting in an NCUA CAMEL composite rating of 4 or worse, and the SSA CAMEL composite rating is better than the NCUA’s CAMEL composite rating, require an onsite supervision contact to more fully evaluate material risks. Examiners must consider the implications of the CAMEL composite rating on a FISCU’s troubled condition designation. Per <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=08a307da99a24051ccd8646e77eb30c4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14</a>, either the NCUA or the SSA can declare a FISCU in troubled condition; however, the NCUA will not designate a FISCU to be in troubled condition without first making an onsite contact at a FISCU.</p>
        <p>For CAMEL composite 4 or 5 ratings, an onsite supervision contact must be completed within 60 calendar days of completing the WCC 26 review to validate the CAMEL rating and trigger the troubled condition designation. Examiners must start this onsite contact within ten business days of the WCC 26 review upload for the same FISCUs where there is an official or senior executive officer vacancy. The executive director must approve exceptions to this policy.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">A WCC 26 review is not the measure for a troubled condition designation, the subsequent onsite contact is. See the NSPM&#160;for <a href="../../DistrictMgmt/06-Notice_of_Troubled_Condition/FISCUs.htm">more information on notices of troubled condition for FISCUs</a>.<br /></p>
