            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />Onsite Supervision Contacts (WCC 23)</h3>
        <p>An onsite supervision contact is more limited in scope than an examination or a follow-up examination. Examiners will typically perform an onsite supervision contact to review targeted risk area(s), to hold a joint conference if it could not be completed as part of the exam, and/or to review the credit union’s compliance with a DOR, etc.</p>
        <h4>Onsite Contact Timeframes</h4>
        <p>Examiners will perform onsite supervision contacts as needed between regular or follow-up examinations based on the nature and severity of the problems or as their supervisor requires. Examiners will need to make each contact a results-oriented contact designed to achieve corrective action. The NCUA EIC or supervisor will coordinate with the SSA as appropriate.</p>
        <p>The NCUA EIC, in consultation with their supervisor, will determine whether to accept the SSA’s limited scope onsite contacts to resolve recordkeeping problems in place of an NCUA onsite contact. When review of an SSA report (WCC 26 Review) discloses material recordkeeping problems, the examiner will contact their supervisor and the SSA to determine if an onsite contact is necessary. See the <a href="../../AuditsRecordkeeping/05-Significant_Recordkeeping_Concern.htm">Significant Recordkeeping Concerns</a> section of the NSPM&#160;for additional guidance on performing supervision contacts for credit unions that have significant recordkeeping concerns.</p>
        <h4>Onsite Contact Documentation</h4>
        <p>Examiners document an onsite supervision contact by uploading an AIRES file, charging time to WCC 23. Examiners need to upload a completed Scope module and sufficient AIRES work papers to support the scope of review and conclusions. At a minimum, the AIRES upload must include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">AIRES historical download, Exam.xls, and all critical input areas</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Sections in the Scope module that were the subject of the contact, including pertinent final risk ratings. Examiners will document their explanations of any change of final risk ratings in the Scope module. For any areas not reviewed in the module, “n/a” or “DNR” (did not review) will suffice.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Written narrative report provided to the credit union if applicable (for example, Examination Overview, Examiner’s Findings, etc.). Use the Confidential Section to document additional information when a report is not provided to the credit union and in place of a supervision contact memo.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Completed EMC</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Updated <a href="../../../Resources/APP-DistrictMgmt/Supervision Chronology Report.docx#appendix1a">Supervision Chronology Report</a> saved in the examination directory for a CAMEL 3 with assets $250 million and greater, and CAMEL 4 or 5</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Any other information necessary to support the scope and time spent on the contact (for example, updated and completed DOR module if focus of contact was to review compliance with DOR items, completed Consumer Compliance Violations module if focus was to review compliance violations)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examiners will discuss their findings and recommendations during an exit meeting and issue a written report to the officials if the contact results in required action or changes to CAMEL or risk ratings.</p>
