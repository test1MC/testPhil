        <h1>FISCU Program and Procedures</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />The SSA is the primary regulator for federally insured, state-chartered credit unions, whereas the NCUA is responsible for managing risk to the share insurance fund. Supervision efforts at FISCUs will vary depending on the size of the credit union, the risk to the share insurance fund, and other circumstances as applicable. Supervision includes, but is not limited to, examinations, follow-up examinations, onsite contacts, offsite contacts, offsite monitoring, and trending analysis. (for example, Call Report/FPR Trending). The NCUA’s FISCU examination program institutes standards for a high quality examination process and establishes guidelines to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Empower staff to work collaboratively with each SSA to assess the financial and operational condition of FISCUs</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Identify, prioritize, and mitigate current and emerging risks to the share insurance fund</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure credit unions comply with applicable laws, regulations, and directives</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Initiate appropriate corrective actions supported by a sufficiently detailed administrative record</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Facilitate timely resolution of supervisory concerns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>FISCUs sign an Application and Agreement for Insurance and agree to comply with <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Regs/Pages/Regulations.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a> <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f7487481e89b2eb482b7ff41baabd9c8&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr741_main_02.tpl" target="_blank">Part 741</a> when applying for federal share insurance. The Document of Cooperation between NASCUS and the NCUA is the overarching document laying out the principles and the relationship with SSAs and the insurance review process.</p>
        <p>Each region maintains an operating agreement with each individual state. The operating agreements outline the method and procedures to monitor FISCUs for insurance risk. Regions will document any changes to procedures or any special arrangements made with an individual state in an addendum that the NCUA’s Office of General Counsel will review.</p>
        <p>This section of the NSPM&#160;explains how examiners will supervise FISCUs in their districts and identifies the different types of FISCU examination and supervision options available for examiners. The examination and supervision program is the most important component of managing risk to the share insurance fund and protecting members. Refer to the <a href="../../Resources/APP-FISCUprogram/Examination and Supervision Comparison Matrix.docx">comparison of examination and supervision programs for federal credit unions and federally insured, state-chartered credit unions</a> for a high-level overview.</p>
