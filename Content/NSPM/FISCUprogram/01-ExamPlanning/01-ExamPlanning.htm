        <h2>Examination Planning</h2>
        <p>Advance pre-planning is critical for effective examinations.  Poor planning before going onsite often leads to unnecessary burden on credit unions and miscommunication between the NCUA and credit union staff.  For example, each Items Needed list must be customized to only request items unique and necessary to address the scope and risk profile for each credit union exam.  Examiners must keep a copy of the customized Items Needed&#160;list within the AIRES&#160;file so it becomes part of the administrative record.</p>
        <p>Failing to pre-plan can cause frustration for credit unions that spend significant amounts of time gathering information that an examiner does not review.</p>
        <p>When planning for a FISCU&#160;exam, examiners will ensure coordination with the SSA and compliance with the NSPM. This includes coordinating with the SSA on the planned scope and coordination between specialists scheduled for the exam (for example, create one Items Needed list), to the maximum extent possible. Examiners should also inquire and discuss any changes since the last exam with the SSA.</p>
