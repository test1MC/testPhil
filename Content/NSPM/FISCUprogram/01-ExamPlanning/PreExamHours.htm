        <h3>Pre-Exam Planning Hours</h3>
        <p>Examiners will use WCC 95, Pre-Exam Planning FISCU, on weekly time reports to capture time spent pre-planning a FISCU examination.  These hours are separate from, and in addition to, the budgeted hours for examining a credit union.  Examiners will document their pre-planning activities with the Pre-Exam Planning Questionnaire and upload it with the examination.</p>
        <p>Pre-exam hours must be recorded for each completed WCC&#160;11 exam. Exceptions to the budgeted time must be approved in writing by a supervisor, in advance.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"> The Pre-Exam Planning Questionnaire is available in the AIRES Scope module.</p>
