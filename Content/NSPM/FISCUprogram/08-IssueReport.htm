        <h2>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />Issuing a Report to a Federally Insured, State-Chartered Credit Union</h2>
        <p>Generally, during joint contacts, the SSA issues the final report and uploads the AIRES examination (some state exceptions do exist). The NCUA examiner will also upload an AIRES file. In instances where the NCUA takes the lead, as a courtesy, the SSA should have an opportunity to review the finalized examination report prior to issuance to the credit union. However, issuance of the report is at the NCUA’s discretion. NCUA staff will invite the SSA to the joint conference.</p>
        <p>NCUA examiners will provide the SSA EIC with the working papers of their review areas upon completion of the fieldwork. The NCUA EIC will draft sections or work with the SSA to draft sections of the Examination Overview, DOR, or comparable document pertaining to the NCUA’s areas of concern including documentation to support the report’s findings and conclusions. The NCUA EIC will also work with the SSA EIC to include the NCUA comments in the AIRES Scope module for NCUA review areas.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">It is important that examiners clearly document the day, time, and version of documents provided to the SSA for inclusion in the final report.  This can be accomplished through an email chain. </p>
        <p>To ensure the best possible results in resolving any anticipated dispute with the SSA examiner, the NCUA EIC will identify and discuss with the SSA examiner, as early as possible in the examination process, any corrective actions to be required of the FISCU, including respective CAMEL component and composite ratings.</p>
        <p>Any disagreements concerning the content of documents will be resolved prior to meeting with FISCU management. If agreement is not possible at the examiner level, NCUA examiners will contact their supervisor who will discuss the matter with the SSA office and ARDP. If agreement is still not possible, examiners will draft an NCUA&#160;Concerns section for the SSA to include in the issued report. This should outline the issues and required resolution. Examiners will work to obtain agreement from the SSA to include this section in the final report to management. Should the SSA not include this section, examiners will discuss these concerns with their supervisor, provide documentation in the WCC 26 review regarding the issues, and draft a Regional Director letter to the FISCU stating the NCUA’s concerns and necessary corrective action.</p>
