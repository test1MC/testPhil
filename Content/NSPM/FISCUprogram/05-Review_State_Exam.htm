        <h2>Completing a Review of a State Examination (WCC 26)</h2>
        <p>Examiners will review all state examinations, regardless of whether they participated with the SSA or not. The effective date of the review must match the effective date of the AIRES WCC 11 examination. </p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">WCC 26 reviews are not required for supervision contacts performed by the SSA.</p>
        <h3>Receipt of SSA Examination</h3>
        <p>The first step in completing a review of a state examination is the receipt of the SSA examination. For states using AIRES, examiners receive a confirmation email from SysAIRES notifying them of the examination report upload and they can use the link in the email to download the file. Otherwise, the SSA sends a hard copy of the report to the regional office who will then forward it on to the examiner.</p>
        <h3>Timeframes</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />Examiners will upload WCC 26 reviews for FISCUs in their district within 30 calendar days of receipt. Supervisors may approve workload-based extensions up to 45 days. The 30 days will start the day examiners receive a confirmation email from AIRES notifying them of the examination report upload (or if the report is submitted hard copy, the day the regional office provides examiners with the report).</p>
        <h3>Review of the SSA Report</h3>
        <p>When completing a WCC 26 review, examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine whether the report identifies and addresses the material issues</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Identify and document the SSA’s supervision efforts and the NCUA’s supervision efforts</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine the appropriateness of the SSA’s supervision</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine any CAMEL differences and communicate, through their supervisor, any adverse differences in the composite rating to the SSA (for example, CAMEL 3, 4 or 5)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If an NCUA examiner assigns a composite CAMEL rating of 4 or 5 during the WCC 26 review and the NCUA CAMEL rating is worse than the rating the SSA assigned and the NCUA did not participate in the examination, the NCUA examiner will schedule an onsite contact to more fully evaluate material risks. The NSPM&#160;<a href="04-Supervision_Contacts/Review_SSA_Exam.htm">outlines the required timeframes for completing the onsite contact</a> .</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If it was a joint examination, document whether the material issues and agreed-upon concerns are in the final report (for example, Examination Overview, DOR)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine if risk has been properly identified and addressed by the SSA</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document any material risk the examination report does not adequately cover</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Recommend whether a joint examination or contact is necessary. If the concerns are significant, examiners may recommend a joint contact rather than wait until the next joint examination</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document recommended actions or communication to resolve any material risk oversights or inadequate corrective action identified in the SSA report. For example, examiners may draft a Regional Director letter to the SSA if the report failed to identify or properly address material concerns. Examiners will first discuss the concerns with their supervisor, who in turn will discuss with their SSA counterpart. If the issue cannot be resolved at that level, a Regional Director letter may be necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The review should not be a recap of the SSA’s report but rather an analysis of the operational and financial condition of the credit union. Examiners will provide enough information to give a clear picture of this condition.</p>
        <h3>AIRES Procedures </h3>
        <p>Examiners perform all WCC 26 reviews in AIRES. Examiners will use the EMC and Scope module to document the review. To complete a WCC 26 review, examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Review the state’s report</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Enter <b>26</b> in the contact type in AIRES</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Complete the <b>Review of State Examination</b> questionnaire<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">This requires examiners to answer the eight questions relating to the WCC 26 review. Examiners access the <b>Review of State Examination</b> questionnaire via the hyperlink in the upper right hand corner of the <b>Final Assessment</b> tab. Examiners must provide comments for any question answered with no for questions two through six.</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Complete the <b>Final Assessment</b> tab in the Scope module, providing the following input for the seven areas of risk:<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Final Risk Assessment</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reasons for Risk Assessment</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Anticipated Direction of Risk</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reasons for Anticipated Direction</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Complete the <b>Plans and Budget</b> tab in the Scope module<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Complete this tab to show budget projections for the next examination cycle. Standard budgeted hours anticipated for Call Report review and WCC 26 reviews do not need to be included.</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Record their time and complete the <b>Completion Information</b> tab</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Enter problem codes in the DOR module that need to be tracked and not included by the SSA<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">For items in the SSA report that meet the <a href="../AdminRemedies/03-DOR/DOR.htm">NCUA’s definition of a DOR</a>, NCUA examiners are required to enter the DOR, problem code and corrective action in the DOR module if the SSA did not do so in its AIRES upload (or if the SSA does not use AIRES). SSA DORs that do not meet the NCUA definition may be entered at the examiner’s discretion.</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Create new problem code(s) in the DOR module under <b>Items Excluded from DOR</b> if there are problem codes and corrective action items identified during NCUA examiner’s WCC 26 review but not identified in the SSA report.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Enter both the NCUA and SSA CAMEL ratings on the <b>CAMEL worksheet</b> in Exam.xls and enter any comments concerning the CAMEL rating and differences on this tab</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Complete the <b>Consumer Compliance Violations</b> module in AIRES, as applicable, for any violations (significant BSA violations) not addressed or reported correctly in the SSA report</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Discuss any plan of action with their supervisor, as applicable</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Perform any necessary follow-up action (for example, verbal communication with the SSA, Regional Director letter), as applicable</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Upload the completed AIRES file</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ShadedBox">If an NCUA examiner assigns a composite CAMEL rating of 4 or 5 during a WCC 26 review where the NCUA examiner did not participate onsite and the SSA CAMEL rating is better, he or she <a href="04-Supervision_Contacts/Review_SSA_Exam.htm">must schedule an onsite contact to more fully evaluate material risks</a> before the FISCU can be considered in troubled condition. Refer to the NSPM&#160;for <a href="../DistrictMgmt/06-Notice_of_Troubled_Condition/FISCUs.htm">more information about FISCUs in troubled condition</a>.</p>
