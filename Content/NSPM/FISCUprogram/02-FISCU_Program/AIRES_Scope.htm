            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />AIRES Scope</h3>
        <p>The scope is the permanent record of procedures performed during an examination or supervision contact. All WCC 11 examination procedures will be guided by the expectations outlined in most recent <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Instruction5000.flsnp" />.</p>
        <p>Examiners must thoroughly document the areas reviewed, the results, and the recommended action. Comments like "completed" or “inadequate” are not sufficient. Examiners must include a description of the area reviewed and results obtained regardless of whether references to other work papers are included in the AIRES Scope module. Examiners must complete the Plans and Budget tab in the AIRES Scope module.</p>
        <p>The Scope module should be a comprehensive synopsis of what occurred during the examination or supervision contact. However, when applicable, the completed IRR workbook represents the scope for the IRR review and for scope module purposes, it is acceptable for examiners to state “Refer to IRR workbook” in the Results of Review section of the scope. Additionally, examiners may use the narrative conclusion for the final risk assessment. The IRR workbook framework includes the necessary scope elements of review steps (either required or baseline), fields to enter the results of each review step, a narrative conclusion (in the overall tab), and the IRR rating (high, moderate, or low).</p>
        <p>A comprehensive scope will enable the examiner of the next examination to become familiar with the history of the credit union in a shorter amount of time. (See <a href="../../FCUprogram/01-ExamPlanning/SufficientScoping.htm">examples of sufficient scoping detail</a>.) When completing the Scope module and areas of review, all team members with an SME designation will include their designation, in parenthesis, next to their initials in the “Done by” column.</p>
        <p>EICs are responsible for the sufficiency of the AIRES Scope module.  For team exams/supervision contacts, the EIC should complete the Preliminary Risk Assessment and Current Area of Review section of the Exam Scope in advance of the rest of the team’s arrival onsite. EICs need to evaluate the appropriateness of the scope and document procedures commensurate with the size and complexity of the credit union throughout the course of the examination or supervision contact. EICs will fully evaluate those areas representing a significant risk or potential risk to the credit union.</p>
        <p>Examiners will review these plans and determine whether the plans are reasonable and appropriate for the size and complexity of the credit union. Refer to the “Review Areas” worksheet in Exam.xls in AIRES for additional suggested scope areas. Examiners must adequately explain any changes from the preliminary risk assessment to the final risk assessment to justify the final risk ratings.</p>
