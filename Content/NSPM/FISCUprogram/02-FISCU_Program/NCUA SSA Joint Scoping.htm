            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />NCUA-SSA Joint Scoping</h3>
        <p>Scoping for FISCU joint examinations and contact may vary and will consider the relationship with the SSA. Meeting(s) with the SSA examiner to establish the NCUA’s scope and support resources will be held prior to or at the start of fieldwork. The meeting may be a telephone contact or via secure email. The examiner responsible for setting up the meeting will depend on the working arrangement with each SSA. The examiner’s objective of the scoping meeting is to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Discuss the issues initiating the contact</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Discuss any new information</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Define operational and financial concerns</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Establish review areas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The NCUA’s role in conducting joint examinations and contacts is limited to significant risk areas and compliance with laws and regulations for which the NCUA has enforcement authority. When a review reveals additional safety and soundness concerns, examiners will expand the scope and review time in consultation with their supervisor.</p>
        <p>If agreements cannot be reached regarding the NCUA’s participation, including expansion of the scope, the NCUA examiner will contact their supervisor prior to or during the examination, who will discuss the matter with the SSA office. Supervisors will request ARDP involvement in the event the supervisor and the SSA office cannot resolve the issue.</p>
        <p>When completing the Scope module and areas of review, all team members with an SME designation will include their designation, in parenthesis, next to their initials in the Done by column.</p>
