        <h3>NCUA Onsite Presence Criteria</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />Onsite participation (including joint examinations, insurance reviews, and onsite supervision contacts) in FISCUs is necessary to effectively assess conditions that may pose a risk to the share insurance fund.  The Regional Director will determine the onsite participation plans for FISCUs as part of the annual resource budget process and in accordance with <a href="../../DistrictMgmt/01-Budget_and_Schedule_Exams/Exam_Scheduling_Program.htm">NCUA’s Examination Scheduling Program</a>. Since SSAs vary in their approach to onsite supervision between full examinations, the degree to which each region can utilize SSA examination and supervision work will also vary.</p>
        <p>The NCUA will notify the SSA of all FISCUs selected for onsite contacts. Each regional office will provide the specific criteria and reports used in making these selections to the state to ensure their awareness of which credit unions the NCUA will select for an onsite contact.</p>
