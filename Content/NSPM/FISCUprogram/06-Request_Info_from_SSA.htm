            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />Requesting Additional Information from an SSA</h2>
        <p>Examiners notify their supervisor when the SSA report is lacking adequate information to determine the risk. Depending on the relationship with the SSA, the supervisor may contact the SSA or may reach an agreement with the SSA for the examiner to contact the SSA office or the SSA EIC directly to gather additional information. If the examiner does not receive the requested information, the examiner will draft an appropriate Regional Director letter and cover memo. The supervisor will also contact the SSA when the reviews or any other information reveals a need for an immediate contact at a specific FISCU.</p>
