        <h2>Communication with an SSA</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />Open communication between the NCUA and the state supervisory authority is critical to ensure a robust and effective management of risk to the share insurance fund posed by FISCUs.</p>
        <h3>Supervisor Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>The NCUA supervisor’s interaction with the SSA is a critical link in this relationship. Therefore, the supervisor will be the primary party responsible for maintaining open and effective communication. The supervisor will maintain both formal and informal communication with the SSA. The supervisor will conduct such meetings as necessary to establish and maintain a positive relationship. However, in those states with few state-chartered credit unions or strong FISCU supervision programs, less frequent and/or more informal communication may be sufficient. Regardless of the circumstances, supervisors should meet face-to-face with SSAs at least annually. The meetings will focus on scheduling, supervision, credit union problem resolution, and addressing issues between respective examiners.</p>
        <p>In addition to the face-to-face meetings, the supervisor will maintain phone and email contacts with the SSA for complex or problem credit unions (for example, credit unions with more than $250 million in assets, credit unions exhibiting negative trends or insurability concerns, credit unions with a composite CAMEL rating of 4 or 5, and credit unions with a composite CAMEL rating of 3 or below which in the supervisor’s judgment present a material risk to the share insurance fund).</p>
        <p>Each December, supervisors will provide the SSA with a list of credit unions the NCUA plans to conduct an examination/supervision contact. The supervisor will state the reason for the NCUA going onsite and may expand or reduce the list throughout the year, as new financial data is available. This will eliminate unwelcome surprises and enable the SSA to plan for NCUA participation into their schedules.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">The NCUA reserves the right to go into any FISCU as frequently as warranted, based on risk to the share insurance fund, and may conduct an independent onsite contact when unable to coordinate a joint contact with the SSA. The NCUA will notify the SSA prior to initiating any such contact and share the report with the SSA prior to submission to the FISCU.</p>
        <h3>Regional Director and Associate Regional Director Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>The RD or designated ARDP will meet with the SSA at least once a year. Meetings will focus on the operating agreement, discussing roles, responsibilities, and expectations for the NCUA and the SSA.</p>
