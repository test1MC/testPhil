        <h2>Joint Conferences for Federally Insured, State-Chartered Credit Unions</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />Joint examinations of FISCUs with a CAMEL rating of a 3, 4, or 5 will include a joint conference with a majority of the board of directors. NCUA staff will attend these meetings, appropriately addressing all NCUA concerns. Examiners will disclose the NCUA CAMEL ratings (components and composite) to the board both verbally and in writing, as described in NCUA Letter to Credit Unions 11-CU-12, <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/Pages/policy-compliance/communications/letters-to-credit-unions/2011/12.aspx" target="_blank">Disclosing CAMEL Ratings to Federally Insured State Credit Unions (FISCUs)</a>. Examiners may reformat the CAMEL Evaluation Form available in AIRES, provided that all the information is documented in the alternate format.</p>
        <p>The SSA examiner and the NCUA EIC will hold an exit meeting in CAMEL 1 or 2 FISCUs if a joint conference is not necessary or requested. In this situation, examiners will disclose the NCUA CAMEL ratings during the exit meeting. Exit meetings should occur as soon as possible after the completion of fieldwork subject to reasonable accommodation for SSA advance review of draft documents.</p>
        <p>The timeframe for scheduling joint conferences and exit meetings should comply with the 60-day guideline for examination completion.</p>
