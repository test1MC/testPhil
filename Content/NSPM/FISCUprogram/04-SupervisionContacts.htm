        <h2>Supervision Contacts</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />The NCUA supervises FISCUs, based on the risk to the share insurance fund, through onsite contacts and offsite monitoring of statistical financial reports, etc. FISCUs presenting an increased insurability risk will receive onsite supervision contacts. The EIC and supervisor, in consultation with the ARDP, will determine the frequency and timing of onsite supervision contacts. Onsite contacts may be appropriate for focused reviews of identified risks, reduced or limited participation in a contact of a FISCU with less than $250 million in assets, or for ongoing supervision of problem credit unions.</p>
        <p>The NCUA will make every effort to coordinate joint NCUA/SSA contacts but reserves the right to perform independent onsite contacts. For instance, if the NCUA suspects fraud at a credit union, then an immediate onsite contact will be necessary.</p>
        <p>The NCUA may perform independent onsite contacts when necessary due to scheduling issues. The NCUA will offer to provide the SSA a draft copy of solo NCUA contact reports prior to issuance to the FISCU. The SSA may also perform solo onsite supervision contacts. If the SSA issues a report, the NCUA examiner has the option of reviewing the SSA supervision reports and charging offsite supervision time to WCC 28.</p>
        <p>The NCUA considers the timing of the next SSA examination when scheduling onsite supervision. However, if a timely joint contact is not possible, the NCUA may need to make an onsite contact independent of the SSA. The NCUA supervisor is responsible for contacting the SSA if onsite supervision is necessary prior to the next scheduled examination. If the NCUA supervisor and SSA cannot reach an agreement regarding necessary action, the supervisor will contact the ARDP who will further discuss the concerns with the SSA and make necessary arrangements either for a joint contact or an independent NCUA contact.</p>
