        <p>Examiners will upload AIRES contacts for FISCU onsite contacts as they would for FCUs. Examiners will <a href="../DistrictMgmt/08-AdministrativeItems/Exam_Supervision_Completion_Date.htm">enter the examination completion date on the “Completion Information” tab of the EMC in AIRES</a>. The examination/supervision completion date is the day the examiner last charged time to the examination and is required to be within five business days of the latest of the following dates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Date of last onsite</li>
            <li>Date of exit meeting</li>
            <li>Date of joint conference</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ShadedBox">If the examination completion date exceeds five business days due to items such as conferences, training, annual or sick leave, the examiner will document the circumstance(s) in the Confidential Section noting supervisor concurrence.</p>
