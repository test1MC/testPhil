        <h2>Federally Insured, State-Chartered Credit Union Consumer Compliance Program</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="FISCUs" />NCUA Instruction 12400.05, <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Directives/Instructions/12400.05.pdf" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink">Processing Complaints Against Credit Unions and Documenting Compliance Violations</a> (Apr. 23, 2004) addresses compliance evaluation in FISCUs. If the SSA is responsible for determining consumer compliance in the FISCU, the SSA’s procedural responsibilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Completing the consumer compliance checklists during the examination</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If compliance violations are identified in the FISCU<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Entering violation(s) in the Consumer Compliance Violations module in AIRES (optional)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Entering problem code(s) in the DOR module</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Describing the problem/deficiency and the actions the credit union plans to initiate in order to resolve the situation (preferably using the Supplementary Facts document)</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Continuing to upload the violation(s) in AIRES (or email the examination, including the compliance forms/documents, to the regional office)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a compliance violation exists, and the SSA did not complete the Consumer Compliance Violations module in AIRES, the NCUA examiner completes it during the WCC 26 review.</p>
        <p>If the credit union is unable or unwilling to take corrective action, the NCUA examiner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reviews the situation</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Consults with their supervisor to determine what further action, if any, is needed on the NCUA’s part</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Seeks assistance from OGC if violations are serious (examiner should work through the regional office to seek assistance)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Notifies their supervisor and the SSA of the determination</li>
        </ul>
