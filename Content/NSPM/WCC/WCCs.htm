        <h1>Work Classification Codes</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="WCCs" />Examiners use work classification codes on weekly time reports. An AIRES upload must be used to report the time in the examination and supervision system for time codes with “AIRES” noted in the definition column of the sections listed below. For any other program time code, an AIRES upload is optional, as directed by regional management.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="WCC-General.htm">General codes</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="WCC-Admin.htm">Administrative codes</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="WCC-SME.htm">Subject matter examiner codes</a>

        <h2>Reporting Bank Secrecy Act Review Time</h2>
        <p>The Office of Examination and Insurance tracks time spent reviewing BSA compliance during examinations, insurance reviews, and on-site and off-site supervision contacts. Examiners will record the number of hours spent reviewing BSA compliance in the <i>BSA HRS</i> column in TMS.NET. Similar to the way SME hours are recorded, total contact hours will include the BSA review hours. If a CC SME is performing the BSA review, time should be included in both the SME hours column and BSA review column of TMS.</p>
        <h2>Reporting Specialist Time</h2>
        <p>Time spent by specialists (RLS, RCMS, RISO, PSS) working in their particular specialty area or providing/receiving training in their specialty area will be recorded in TMS.NET using the <i>Specialist Type</i> and <i>Specialist Hours</i> columns. This includes examination and supervision work, training, or any other administrative time associated with a specialist area not reported in WCC 05, 07, or 19.</p>
