                <MadCap:concept term="Fraud" />Fraud Indicator Report</h1>
            <p>The Fraud Indicator Report uses credit union financial performance data and other available information to identify characteristics indicating internal fraud may be present.<MadCap:footnote>The NCUA is prohibited from sharing SAR or PASS data with any external parties, including SSAs, in accordance with the outstanding Memorandums of Understanding between the NCUA and FinCEN and the Federal Reserve. However, the Regional Director may share the fraud indicator report flags from 5300 Call Report data with the respective SSA. </MadCap:footnote> The report flags credit unions based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Irregular financial patterns or extreme outliers for specific financial metrics from the 5300 Call Report compared to assets and/or peer. Credit unions are flagged if they exhibit financial indicators that are more than two standard deviations from the mean.</li>
                <li>Unresolved DOR items related to recordkeeping and internal controls.</li>
                <li>Data gathered from the U.S. Treasury Department’s FinCEN SAR database. SARs are filed by a regulator or financial institution to report on either credit union personnel or the credit union itself when there are indications of unusual transactions within a credit union’s accounts The Fraud Indicator Report flags a credit union if there was at least one SAR filed on the credit union or credit union personnel within the last twelve months.</li>
                <li>The Federal Reserve Bank Payment Analysis and Screening System (PASS) data. This data is used to identify the possibility of fraudulent activity occurring with the credit union’s Automated Clearing House, wire transfer, and currency activity. The Fraud Indicator Report flags credit unions that show irregularities with the volume of transactions based on asset size and significant increases in transaction activity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Offsite Review Policy</h2>
            <p>Each quarter, E&amp;I will post the Fraud Indicator Report to the NCUA’s internal <a href="http://ncuacentral/EANDI/eiworkgroups/antifraud/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Anti-Fraud SharePoint Site</a> and notify field staff of its availability.<MadCap:footnote>To ensure data integrity, the Fraud Indicator Report will use final scrubbed Call Report data; the report will have a one-quarter lag. For example, E&amp;I will post the first quarter report by the end of the second quarter.</MadCap:footnote>  Field staff will use the Fraud Risk Indicator Report as part of the offsite monitoring and examination scoping process.</p>
            <h2>Onsite Review Policy</h2>
            <p>Each quarter, E&amp;I will review the Fraud Indicator Report and conduct further reviews on credit unions with six or more indicators, or on a case by case basis when conditions indicate elevated risk and determine if any credit unions warrant an onsite fraud contact. E&amp;I will send a memo to the Regional Director detailing the credit unions that require an onsite fraud contact.<MadCap:footnote style="mc-footnote-position: page;">Not all credit unions with six or more indicators will require an onsite contact.</MadCap:footnote>  The memo will outline the specific fraud indicators identified for each credit union.<MadCap:footnote>When coordinating onsite contacts in FISCUs, the NCUA may not disclose to the SSA that the contact is a result of FinCEN or PASS data flagged on the Fraud Indicator Report. </MadCap:footnote></p>
            <p>Upon receipt of the E&amp;I memo, the Regional Director will assign field staff with appropriate expertise to complete the onsite fraud contact.<MadCap:footnote>“Appropriate expertise” generally means a Record Keeping and Internal Controls Subject Matter Examiner or an examiner with a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) designation. Regional Directors should consider assigning staff other than the assigned district examiner to complete the onsite contact when necessary.</MadCap:footnote>  The region has 120 days from receipt of the memo to begin the onsite fraud contact, during which field staff will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use WCC 90 or WCC 91 to document the onsite fraud contact.</li>
                <li>Document their review of the flagged fraud indicators in the Scope Module. See the Fraud Indicator Report Onsite Contact Review Procedures document on the NCUA’s <a href="http://ncuacentral/EANDI/eiworkgroups/antifraud/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Anti-Fraud SharePoint Site</a> for the most current review procedures for each flag.</li>
                <li>Complete the applicable tabs of the Fraud Workbook.</li>
                <li>Follow up on outstanding DOR items related to triggers in the Fraud Indicator Report.</li>
                <li>Comply with the NSPM requirements for onsite contacts for a <a href="../FCUprogram/04-FCU_Supervision_Contacts/Onsite_Supervision.htm">federal credit union</a> or <a href="../FISCUprogram/04-Supervision_Contacts/Onsite_Supervision_Contacts.htm">FISCU</a>.<MadCap:footnote>For WCC 90 or WCC 91 contacts, field staff are not required to comply with NSPM credit union notification timeframes.</MadCap:footnote></li>
                <li>Include all documentation necessary to support the administrative record.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Due to the sensitive nature of fraud reviews, field staff should not notify the credit union of the purpose for the onsite contact.</p>
