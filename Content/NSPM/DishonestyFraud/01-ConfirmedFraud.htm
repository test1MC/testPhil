                <MadCap:concept term="Fraud" />When Fraud is Confirmed or Highly Suspected</h1>
            <p>As part of the normal supervision process, field staff may become aware of fraud that does not pose a threat to the institution and has been identified and addressed by the credit union. In these instances, field staff will ensure the credit union appropriately handled the fraud.<MadCap:footnote>The extent of the review will depend upon the situation.  For example, in a large credit union that identified a small teller fraud, field staff may review internal audit reports to ensure the situation was appropriately handled.  Alternatively, in a smaller credit union, field staff may need to discuss the matter with management or the Supervisory Committee to ensure appropriate action was taken. </MadCap:footnote>  Field staff will notify their supervisor if they have concerns with how credit union management handled the fraud.</p>
            <p>For any fraud in which field staff are involved in the detection and investigation of, either through the normal supervision process or as a result of a tip from a third party (including fraud that has been identified by the credit union, but was not properly resolved), field staff will complete the <a href="../../Resources/APP-DishonestyFraud/FraudReport.docx">Fraud Report</a>.<MadCap:footnote>The Fraud Report will be uploaded as part of the Exam Directory in AIRES.</MadCap:footnote></p>
            <p>Next steps will vary depending on the extent of the fraud and the individual(s) involved. Field staff will follow the appropriate NCUA policy depending on whether the fraud is classified as <a href="#Level">Level 1</a> or <a href="#Level2">Level 2</a>. The following decision tree will help field staff identify next steps when fraud is discovered.</p>

            <h2><a name="Level"></a>Level 1 Fraud</h2>
            <p>Fraud is categorized as Level 1 if it does not pose a threat to the viability of a credit union or a loss to the Share Insurance Fund, is isolated to one individual or incident and if field staff are relatively certain that credit union management and/or officials are not directly involved. Generally, fraud will be considered a Level 1 fraud if the actual or potential loss exceeds the lesser of five percent of the credit union’s net worth or $500,000.<MadCap:footnote>While not required, on a case-by-case basis supervisors may require examiners to follow Level 1 fraud procedures even if the actual or potential loss is less than the lesser of five percent of the credit union’s net worth or $500,000.</MadCap:footnote></p>
            <p>The supervisory examiner will consult with the ARD on the extent of the NCUA’s involvement, including whether to involve E&amp;I’s Fraud and Risk Analysis Specialist and/or OGC.</p>
            <p>For a Level 1 fraud, examiners will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Notify the supervisory examiner, who will consult with the ARD to determine if a WCC 90 or WCC 91 contact is warranted or if the supervision schedule should be accelerated. If onsite, open a concurrent WCC 90 or WCC 91 to document the fraud investigation.</li>
                <li>Document the facts in the <a href="../../Resources/APP-DishonestyFraud/FraudChronology.docx">Fraud Chronology</a> and include it in the AIRES upload.<MadCap:footnote>If the fraud is identified during an offsite review or through notification by a third party, the examiner will upload the Fraud Chronology as part of the WCC 90 or WCC 91.</MadCap:footnote>  The Fraud Chronology should document all individuals known or suspected to be involved in the fraud.</li>
                <li>Discuss with the supervisory examiner whether to request a personal database search  through DOS on the individual(s) suspected to be involved in the fraud.<MadCap:footnote>More information about Personal Database Searches and instructions for requesting searches are outlined in the Procedures for Requesting Personal Database Search Memo. </MadCap:footnote> DOS will complete the E&amp;I <a href="../../Resources/APP-DishonestyFraud/DatabaseSearchRequestForm.docx">Database Search Request Form</a> on the NCUA’s <a href="http://ncuacentral/EANDI/eiworkgroups/antifraud/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Anti-Fraud SharePoint Site</a>.</li>
                <li>Discuss with the supervisory examiner whether the scope of the current and/or future examination should be expanded to include a review of internal controls and any other areas relevant to the suspected or identified fraud. For example, if the fraud was theft from a teller drawer, the examiner should review the credit union’s cash handling procedures and internal controls.</li>
                <li>Work with the supervisory examiner to notify credit union management, the board of directors, and the Supervisory Committee of the identified or suspected fraud. Field staff should encourage the board of directors to obtain legal counsel and provide the <a href="../../Resources/APP-DishonestyFraud/CU-BOD-FraudDiscoveryChecklist.docx">Fraud Discovery Checklist for Board of Directors</a> as a resource. Examiners should include corrective action plans for the Supervisory Committee to expand their internal control reviews, as necessary.</li>
                <li>Ensure the officials notify the bonding company and law enforcement and file a Suspicious Activity Report. Follow up with the officials to obtain confirmation that a SAR was filed.  Include the confirmation in the WCC 90 or WCC 91 upload.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="ShadedBox">Field staff should remind credit union management that the filing of any SAR is confidential and should not be disclosed to credit union personnel named in the filing.</p>
            <p>If credit union management or officials fail to take proper corrective action, which includes notifying the bonding company or filing a SAR, field staff will notify their supervisor to determine if further action is necessary.</p>
            <p class="ShadedBox">If a Level 1 fraud is subsequently identified as a Level 2 fraud or fraud that involves management or officials, field staff will follow the procedures for a <a href="#Level2">Level 2 fraud</a>.</p>
            <h2><a name="Level2"></a>Level 2 Fraud</h2>
            <p>Fraud is categorized as Level 2 when it threatens the viability of a credit, will cause a loss to the Share Insurance Fund, or management or officials are likely involved.</p>
            <p>For example, if a CEO misuses a corporate credit card for personal expenses, the dollar amount may not threaten the viability of the credit union, but it shows the CEO is willing and able to commit a dishonest act. This could indicate additional, yet uncovered fraud, and at a minimum may threaten future bond claims or the CEO’s ability to be bonded. A fraud that is potentially pervasive to the institution should also be treated as a Level 2 fraud.</p>
            <p>If a potential Level 2 fraud is detected during an offsite review or through notification by a third party (for example, credit union employee, state supervisory authority), field staff will immediately notify the supervisory examiner. Field staff will schedule an onsite fraud contact (WCC 90 or 91) within three business days of the detection or notification.</p>
            <p>If an examiner identifies a potential Level 2 fraud during an onsite contact, they will immediately notify the supervisory examiner and open a concurrent WCC 90 or WCC 91 to document the fraud investigation.</p>
            <p>When a Level 2 fraud or fraud involving management or officials is suspected or confirmed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The ARD will ensure the onsite contact is staffed with examiners and/or specialists who are have experience addressing internal credit union fraud or the subject area of the suspected fraud.</li>
                <li>Within one business day of determining a probable fraud is occurring, the regional office will notify E&amp;I’s Fraud and Risk Analysis Specialist, AMAC, and OGC. E&amp;I and/or OGC can provide additional resources to staff the onsite contact, if necessary. In addition, OGC may pursue an order of investigation that empowers the NCUA to issue subpoenas for documents and take depositions from sources inside and outside the institution if individuals are uncooperative.</li>
                <li>Field staff will maintain the <a href="../../Resources/APP-DishonestyFraud/FraudChronology.docx">Fraud Chronology</a> and establish the administrative record related to the case.</li>
                <li>The supervisory examiner will work with DOS to ensure all offsite resources (for example, FinCEN database searches, personal database searches) are used to research individuals or third parties suspected in the fraud. If a personal database search is necessary, DOS will complete the E&amp;I <a href="../../Resources/APP-DishonestyFraud/DatabaseSearchRequestForm.docx">Database Search Request Form</a> on the NCUA's <a href="http://ncuacentral/EANDI/eiworkgroups/antifraud/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Anti-Fraud SharePoint Site</a>. Supervisors will discuss with the regional office how and when to notify law enforcement and other authorities as warranted (IRS, etc). Before contacting law enforcement or other authorities, the regional office will consult with E&amp;I’s Fraud and Risk Analysis Specialist and OGC.</li>
                <li>The regional office will consult with OGC regarding filing a prohibition order against the individual(s) involved.</li>
                <li>If field staff believe credit union officials are involved in fraud, the supervisor will consult with the ARD to determine who will notify the bonding company and file a SAR.</li>
                <li>If there is reasonable assurance that officials are not involved, field staff and their supervisor will notify the credit union’s board of the fraud. Field staff can provide the <a href="../../Resources/APP-DishonestyFraud/CU-BOD-FraudDiscoveryChecklist.docx">Fraud Discovery Checklist for Board of Directors</a> as a resource. Field staff will encourage the board of directors to obtain advice of legal counsel and to consider the following actions:<ul><li>Suspend the personnel involved with pay</li><li>Control involved personnel’s access to the credit union</li><li>Fill the operational void caused by any suspension</li><li>Contract to obtain a fraud audit</li><li>Notify surety (bonding company) immediately, as appropriate</li><li>Complete and file a SAR</li></ul></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Field staff cannot direct or require a credit union to terminate or suspend an employee and should ensure that management understands that it is their choice on the appropriate action to take.</p>
            <p class="ShadedBox">Field staff should remind credit union management that the filing of any SAR is confidential and should not be disclosed to credit union personnel named in the filing.</p>
            <p>Depending on the extent and individuals involved (or suspected to be involved) in the fraud, additional enforcement action such as conservatorship or liquidation may be necessary. Field staff will work with the regional office if additional enforcement action is necessary and follow existing policy regarding enforcement actions.</p>
