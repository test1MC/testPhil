            <p>Field staff have four primary responsibilities with respect to fraud:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Conduct defined scope and risk-focused examinations in accordance with agency policy.</li>
                <li>Recognize, document, and investigate the red flags that can indicate the presence of, or opportunity for, fraud.</li>
                <li>Report suspected fraud to their supervisor immediately. Examiners should trust their instincts and consult with their supervisor when fraud is suspected.</li>
                <li>Follow agency policy if fraud is confirmed or highly suspected.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The Examiner’s Guide contains guidance regarding red flags, fraud detection techniques, and investigating fraud.</p>
