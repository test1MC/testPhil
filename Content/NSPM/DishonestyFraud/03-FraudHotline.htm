        <div MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted" class="redacted">
            <p>The Office of General Counsel monitors the toll free NCUA Fraud Hotline (800-827-9650). Upon receiving a report of suspected fraud or other irregularities, OGC will forward a Fraud Hotline Report to the appropriate Regional Director for review, with a copy sent to the E&amp;I Fraud and Risk Analysis Specialist.</p>
            <p>Upon receipt of the complaint, the regional office will send a copy of the Fraud Hotline complaint and any supporting documents to the appropriate supervisor, and provide field staff a copy.</p>
            <p>Field staff will review the fraud complaint and supporting documentation and discuss with their supervisor. The supervisor will determine if an onsite fraud contact (WCC 90 or WCC 91) is necessary  and the timeframe for completing the contact. Field staff will complete and upload the <a href="../../Resources/APP-DishonestyFraud/FraudReport.docx">Fraud Report</a>, along with any other documentation necessary to support the administrative record.</p>
            <p>When conducting an onsite fraud contact, examiners will keep the names of parties filing the complaint confidential. When field staff determined allegations of fraud or improper conduct are substantiated, supervisors are responsible for ensuring appropriate corrective action is initiated at the field level. If the fraud is substantiated examiner should follow agency policy for a <a href="01-ConfirmedFraud.htm">Level 1</a> or <a href="01-ConfirmedFraud.htm">Level 2</a> fraud.</p>
            <p>When it is determined an onsite fraud contact is not warranted, the regional office will provide OGC a justification to support their decision.</p>
