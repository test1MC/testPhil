            <MadCap:concept term="RegulatoryWaivers" />Periodic Review and Revocation of Waivers</h3>
        <p>Examiners will review outstanding regulatory waivers at every examination. Regions will review outstanding regulatory waivers every three years.<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> The three year timeframe review began July 1, 2012.</p></MadCap:footnote> This requirement applies to any waiver that involves authority for ongoing activity (as opposed to a waiver for a single action).</p>
        <p>The Regional Director may revoke a credit union’s waiver, in whole or in part, for substantive, documented safety and soundness reasons. When revoking a waiver, the Regional Director must give written notice to the credit union stating the reasons for the revocation. The notice should also discuss where applicable the treatment and/or grandfathering of activities conducted while the waiver was in force. The revocation is effective upon the credit union’s receipt of the letter from the Regional Director.</p>
        <p>Examiners should first discuss revocation with their supervisor. Examiners will submit a revocation package to their supervisor consisting of a memo, a draft letter, and any other documentation necessary to justify the revocation. The supervisor will send the revocation package to the region’s DOS mailbox. The memo will include a discussion of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Background of the credit union and the problems</li>
            <li>Substantive safety and soundness justification</li>
            <li>Net worth and solvency considerations</li>
            <li>Outstanding administrative and/or documented corrective action</li>
        </ul>
        <p>DOS will review the recommendation. If in agreement, DOS will prepare a concurrence summary to the Regional Director along with the field memo and draft letter. Upon signature, the revocation letter will be sent via expedited mail with a copy to the examiner and supervisor, and SSA if applicable.</p>
        <p>A credit union has 60 days from the date of revocation to appeal the action to the NCUA’s Supervisory Review Committee (SRC). If the SRC upholds the revocation, the credit union has 60 days from the date of the SRC’s decision to appeal the action to the NCUA Board.</p>
