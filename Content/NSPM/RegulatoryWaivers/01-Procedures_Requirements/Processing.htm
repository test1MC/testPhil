            <MadCap:concept term="RegulatoryWaivers" />Processing a Waiver Request</h3>
        <p>In general, the following procedures will be used to process FCU waiver requests. Please refer to each specific waiver type outlined in this section of the NSPM&#160;for unique processing steps. </p>
        <h4>Division of Supervision Initial Review Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>After the regional office receives the credit union’s application, DOS will perform a cursory review to determine whether the credit union request is complete.</p>
        <p>If considered incomplete:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare an incomplete/denial letter and send it to the credit union by the region’s preferred expedited mail delivery</li>
            <li>Ensure the letter lists the additional information the credit union must submit if they would like the request to be considered. DOS will copy the examiner and supervisor on the letter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If considered complete:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare an acknowledgment letter and send it to the credit union by the region’s preferred expedited mail delivery service</li>
            <li>Prepare and send a work assignment to the field that includes the credit union’s request, application package, supporting documentation, and request a recommendation for approval or denial</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Field Staff Review Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>Examiners and their supervisor will evaluate the credit union’s net worth, CAMEL and risk ratings, and financial strength, and provide a recommendation whether to grant the request. The scope and depth of the examiner’s review will be scaled according to the materiality of the waiver request.</p>
        <p>The examiner, with supervisor approval, will determine if an onsite contact is necessary.</p>
        <p>After review, examiners will determine if the waiver package is complete, and take the following actions, based on their determination.</p>
        <p>If considered incomplete:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Draft the appropriate incomplete/denial letter (refer to <a href="../12-Templates-Waivers/Templates-Waivers.htm">templates provided</a>), or</li>
            <li>Informally contact the credit union to obtain the missing information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If considered complete:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete a Regional Summary to include an approval or denial recommendation</li>
            <li>Draft a letter for approval, partial approval, deferral, or denial</li>
            <li>Email the approval, partial approval, deferral, or denial letter, Regional Summary, and any supporting documentation to their supervisor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The supervisor will review the information, provide supporting reasons for concurrence or non-concurrence, and forward the package to the region’s DOS mailbox.</p>
        <p>If recommending denial, examiners will not discourage any credit union from applying for reconsideration or filing an appeal, if applicable.</p>
        <h4>Division of Supervision Processing Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>Upon receipt of the field’s recommendation, DOS will review and analyze the recommendation for appropriate support and justification. Upon concurrence, DOS will submit the recommendation and proposed response letter to the Regional Director for approval and signature. DOS will mail the signed letter to the credit union using the region’s preferred expedited mail delivery service and copy both the examiner and supervisor.</p>
        <p>If DOS and/or the Regional Director do not agree with the field’s recommendation, the supervisor will be notified of the reasons. The field will be given the opportunity to further support or revise their recommendation in the Regional Summary and draft revised correspondence, if necessary. DOS finalizes the response letter for the Regional Director’s signature. Once signed, DOS will mail it to the credit union using the region’s preferred expedited mail delivery service and copy both the examiner and supervisor.</p>
