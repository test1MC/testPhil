            <MadCap:concept term="RegulatoryWaivers" />Non-Member Deposits Limitation Waiver</h2>
        <p>Credit union public unit and nonmember accounts cannot exceed the greater of 20 percent of total shares or $3.0 million unless approved by the Regional Director.</p>
        <p>Nonmember share deposits in low-income designated credit unions accepted to meet the matching requirement for loans granted through the Community Development Revolving Loan Program are not subject to the 20 percent limitation on nonmember deposits. Additionally, credit unions must maintain the increase in the total amount of matching share deposits for the duration of the loan.</p>

        <p>If a violation is identified, DOS will respond to the violation using their preferred expedited mail delivery service available, to the credit union advising the board of directors they are in violation of the regulatory limit. The letter will require the board of directors to submit an acceptable plan within 30 days to bring the credit union into compliance (i.e., return nonmember deposits or other reasonable alternative action). If the credit union intends to continue additional nonmember deposit activity, it must submit a waiver package that provides sufficient support in accordance with 701.32(b)(3).</p>
