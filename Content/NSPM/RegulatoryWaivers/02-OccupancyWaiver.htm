            <MadCap:concept term="RegulatoryWaivers" />Occupancy Waiver</h2>
        <p>Excess space is only acceptable when a federal credit union bases a purchase on future needs as outlined in <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=09161294a43e8ecffc21f73573417658&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_136&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.36</a> of <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Exam%20Governance/Rules%20and%20Regulations/NCUA%20Rules%20and%20Regulations.pdf"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a>.</p>

        <h3>Acquired Premises for Future Expansion</h3>
        <p>For premises acquired for the purpose of future expansion, an FCU must partially occupy any within a reasonable period, but no later than six years after the date of acquiring the premises.</p>
        <p>Partially occupy means occupation and use, on a full-time basis, of at least fifty percent of each premises by the FCU, or the FCU and a CUSO in which the federal credit union has a controlling interest.  An FCU must submit a written request for a waiver from the partial occupancy provision or to exceed the six year timeframe.</p>
        <h3>Abandoned Property</h3>
        <p>After premises have been abandoned for four years, an FCU must publicly advertise the property for sale.  The federal credit union must complete the sale within five years of abandonment, unless the NCUA waives this requirement.</p>
        <p>To seek a waiver of the either the partial occupancy requirement or disposal of abandoned property, an FCU must submit a written request to its regional office that fully explains why the FCU needs such a waiver.  The Regional Director will base his or her decision on the reasonableness of achieving compliance with the occupancy provisions.</p>
        <p>Requests which represent an effort to circumvent the occupancy provisions will be denied.  The Regional Director will provide the FCU a written response, either approving or denying the waiver request, within 45 days of the completed request.</p>
