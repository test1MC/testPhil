        <h3 MadCap:autonum="A. ">Field Staff Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Examiners and their supervisors are responsible for evaluating the risk posed by the loan participation waiver request. During the evaluation, the examiner should review all pertinent documents and information to determine if an onsite contact is necessary.</p>
        <p>If this is a new program or the examiner does not have historical information to draw upon, strong consideration to go onsite to evaluate the participation program and the credit union’s current business strategy should be given. If the waiver is complex, the examiner and/or supervisor should consider seeking assistance from a regional lending specialist (RLS) who may be able to offer additional support for concurrence or denial.</p>
