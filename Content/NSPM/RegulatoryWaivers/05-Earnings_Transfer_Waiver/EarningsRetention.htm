            <MadCap:concept term="RegulatoryWaivers" />Earnings Retention</h3>
        <p>Beginning the effective date of classification as “adequately capitalized” or lower (less than seven percent net worth), credit unions must increase the dollar amount of their net worth quarterly by at least 0.1 percent of total assets. The 0.1 percent may be calculated from current quarter earnings or from average earnings over the current and three preceding quarters. A transfer of this amount or greater must be from Undivided Earnings to Regular Reserves on a quarterly basis until the credit union becomes “well capitalized.” New credit unions must also increase their net worth quarterly but by the amount reflected in their approved initial or Revised Business Plan (RBP). In the absence of such a plan a new credit union must increase their net worth quarterly in accordance with <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b5cf3c71571def0d4c38dceda54afee5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.702_1201&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§702.201</a>.</p>
        <p>There is always a quarter lag between when a credit union becomes less than well capitalized and when it needs to meet the earnings retention requirements and make a required reserve transfer. For example: XYZ Credit Union, whose net worth category declined to “adequately capitalized” as of March 31, is not required to meet the earnings requirement or make a reserve transfer that quarter because the effective date of its net worth classification is not until April 30. However, starting the quarter-ending June 30, the credit union will need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increase net worth quarterly and make an earnings transfer</li>
            <li>Request a reduction of the Earnings Transfer requirement if it projects it will not meet the quarterly earnings requirement</li>
            <li>Request approval from both the quarterly earnings and reserve transfer requirements if it projects it will not meet the quarterly earnings requirement and also has insufficient Undivided Earnings to make the required quarterly reserve transfer; or</li>
            <li>Request approval to pay dividends from the Regular Reserve as a transfer to the Undivided Earnings account when a deficit in Undivided Earnings exists</li>
        </ul>
