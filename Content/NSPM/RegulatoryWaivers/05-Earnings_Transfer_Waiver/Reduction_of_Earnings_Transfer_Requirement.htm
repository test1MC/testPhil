            <MadCap:concept term="RegulatoryWaivers" />Reduction of the Earnings Transfer Requirement</h3>
        <p>The credit union must submit a written request seeking approval to reduce the amount of Earnings Transfer no later than 14 days before the quarter-end if it cannot meet the earnings and transfer requirements. Examiners should be aware of and work with any credit unions that must meet the quarterly requirements.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, requests for approval from the credit union must explain how the reduction in the earnings requirement is necessary to avoid a significant redemption of shares and further the purposes of PCA. “Furthering the purposes of PCA” can be documented by briefly explaining: why the credit union could not meet the quarterly earnings requirement and how management plans to resolve the earnings problem and increase net worth to meet PCA’s capitalization requirements in future periods. Requests for approval that do not provide this basic information will not be processed.</p>
        <p>Examiners must document and determine a lesser amount a) is necessary to avoid a significant redemption of shares and b) would further the purpose of PCA (as noted in 702.201(b)).</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">The Regional Director may also approve the reduction in earnings retention and the earnings transfer during the processing and approval of a NWRP. If the credit union projects earnings will not meet the earnings retention requirements during any quarter the plan covers, they may request approval for the quarter(s) when they submit their plan to the regional office.<br /><br />When the plan is approved, the reduction in Earnings Transfer is also approved. However, if the credit union originally projects that earnings will be sufficient in their plan and then subsequently fails to meet the requirements, the appropriate request for approval must be submitted within the above timeframe.</p>
        <p>In the case of a state-chartered credit union, the supervisor will request concurrence via phone or e-mail from the appropriate SSA. The SSA will also be copied on the Regional Director’s letter to officials approving or denying the request. Examiners will note whether the SSA concurs with approval or denial for FISCUs in the Regional Summary. Section 702.205(c) no longer includes the earnings retention requirement of <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b5cf3c71571def0d4c38dceda54afee5&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.702_1201&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§702.201</a> as a discretionary supervisory action. This means the SSAs cannot unilaterally approve earnings retention waiver requests from FISCUs.</p>
