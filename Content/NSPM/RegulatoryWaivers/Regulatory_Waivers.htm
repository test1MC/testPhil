            <MadCap:concept term="RegulatoryWaivers" />Regulatory Waivers and other Regulatory Actions</h1>
        <p>The NCUA applies federal statutes, regulations, and directives to achieve strategic goals and ensure uniformity in application of supervision standards. Regulatory waivers afford flexibility in instances where specific criteria are satisfied. The NCUA processes waiver requests in accordance with regulatory requirements and internal directives.</p>
        <p>This section of the NSPM&#160;establishes national policy NCUA staff follow when completing work assignments and examination and supervision of regulatory related waivers and other regulatory related actions. This section is not inclusive of all types of waivers. It reflects <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> as of May 17, 2012. E&amp;I will update the NSPM&#160;when the NCUA Board adopts a new regulation or revises an existing regulation. Examiners should contact their supervisor for assistance outside the scope of this section of the NSPM.</p>
