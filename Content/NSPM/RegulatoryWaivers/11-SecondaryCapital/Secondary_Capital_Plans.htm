        <h4>Division of Supervision Initial Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>Within five calendar days of the regional office receiving a plan, DOS will perform a cursory review to determine whether the plan and proposed secondary capital account(s) meet the minimum regulatory requirements.</p>
        <p>If a plan does not address the required elements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=95fe503344165d256105d93dd8a69be4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_134&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.34(b)(1)</a> or the proposed secondary capital account(s) does not meet regulatory requirements, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact the credit union to obtain the missing information, or</li>
            <li>Prepare an incomplete or denial letter and send it to the credit union by the region’s preferred expedited mail delivery<ul><li>Use the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Respond to Incomplete Proposed Secondary Capital Plan.docx">Respond to Incomplete Proposed Secondary Capital Plan</a> template if the Regional Director opts to defer the request, and ensure the letter lists the required information the credit union must submit for the region to reconsider the plan.</li><li>Use the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Deny Secondary Capital Plan.docx" target="_blank">Deny Secondary Capital Plan</a> template if the Regional Director opts to deny the plan.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>DOS will copy the examiner, supervisory examiner, and SSA, if applicable, on the letter.</p>
        <p>If a plan addresses the required elements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=95fe503344165d256105d93dd8a69be4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_134&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.34(b)(1)</a> and the proposed secondary capital account(s) meets regulatory requirements, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare and send an <a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Acknowledge Submission of Secondary Capital Plan.docx">acknowledgment letter</a> to the credit union using the region’s preferred expedited mail delivery service (for a FISCU, DOS will copy the SSA on the letter)</li>
            <li>Prepare and send a work assignment to the field that includes the credit union’s request, the plan, supporting documentation, and request a recommendation for approval or denial</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Field Staff Review Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>Examiners, their supervisor, and, when appropriate, Regional Capital Markets Specialists will evaluate a credit union’s plan. In evaluating the plan, field staff will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Secondary_Capital_Questionnaire3.0.xlsx" target="_blank">Secondary Capital Questionnaire</a><ul><li>Field staff may not request credit union officials or employees fill out the questionnaire, which is strictly for NCUA field staff use as a guide when reviewing Secondary Capital Plans. See the Capital Section (under development) of the Examiner’s Guide for additional guidance on reviewing Secondary Capital Plans.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Contact the credit union to conduct an interview with management (field staff may use the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Secondary_Capital_Questionnaire3.0.xlsx" target="_blank">Secondary Capital Questionnaire</a> as a guide for the conversation)</li>
            <li>Complete a <a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Regional Summary of Secondary Capital Plan Application.docx#appendix6nn">Regional Summary</a> to include an approval or denial recommendation</li>
            <li>For federal credit unions, draft a letter to approve or deny the proposed plan using the appropriate template<ul><li>A letter informing the credit union of denial must identify required documentation under §701.34(b)(1) that is missing or insufficient. The denial letter must also discuss any related unsafe and unsound condition, including why it is considered unsafe and unsound. Denial letters should not instruct a credit union to resubmit the plan.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Email the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Approve Secondary Capital Plan.docx" target="_blank">approval</a> or <a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Deny Secondary Capital Plan.docx" target="_blank">denial</a> letter (for federal credit unions), the Regional Summary, and any supporting documentation to their supervisor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The field supervisor will review the information, provide supporting reasons for concurrence or non-concurrence, and forward the package to the region’s DOS mailbox.</p>
        <h4>DOS Processing and Review Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>Upon receipt of an examiner’s recommendation, DOS will review and analyze the recommendation for appropriate support and justification.</p>
        <p>If DOS and/or the Regional Director do not agree with the field recommendation, the reasons for the different conclusion will be discussed with the field supervisor. The field will be given the opportunity to further support or revise their recommendation. Regions may consult with the Office of Examination and Insurance during the review process.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">Regional Directors have the authority to approve secondary capital plans.  Concurrence from E&amp;I is not required.  E&amp;I is available to provide additional expertise in the analysis and can provide assistance with the correspondence related to the Regional Director’s decision.</p>
        <p>DOS finalizes the response letter for the Regional Director’s signature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For federal credit unions, DOS will send the response letter directly to the credit union</li>
            <li>For FISCUs, DOS will send a letter with the Regional Director’s concurrence for approval to the SSA</li>
            <li>In the case of disapproval, DOS will send a letter with the Regional Director’s disapproval to both the SSA and the credit union</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Regional Director Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>Regional Directors will only approve secondary capital plans if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All information required under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=95fe503344165d256105d93dd8a69be4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_134&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.34(b)(1)</a> was included in the plan or provided as support</li>
            <li>The proposed secondary capital account(s), and all other actions outlined in the plan (for example, lending and borrowing), comply with applicable regulatory requirements</li>
            <li>The acceptance and use of the secondary capital does not create an unsafe and unsound condition</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For FISCUs, the SSA must grant or deny the request with the concurrence of the Regional Director, in accordance with <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5ee2853d698f7115bf93331781059fb3&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.741_1204&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§741.204(d)</a>.</p>
