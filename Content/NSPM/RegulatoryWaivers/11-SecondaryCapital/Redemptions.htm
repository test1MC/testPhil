            <MadCap:concept term="RegulatoryWaivers" />Secondary Capital Redemptions</h3>
        <p>The board of directors of a LICU may submit a written request to redeem secondary capital to the Regional Director for approval. Under <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5ee2853d698f7115bf93331781059fb3&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.741_1204&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§741.204(d)</a>, FISCUs must also submit the request to the state supervisory authority, who will approve or deny the request with the concurrence of the Regional Director.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=09afd4de603d32cf6767c1f2f734f303&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_134&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">Section 701.34(d)(1)</a> contains the minimum requirements to redeem secondary capital:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The credit union has a post-redemption net worth classification of “adequately capitalized” under <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f7487481e89b2eb482b7ff41baabd9c8&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr702_main_02.tpl" target="_blank">Part 702</a></li>
            <li>The discounted secondary capital has been on deposit at least two years</li>
            <li>The discounted secondary capital will not be needed to cover losses prior to the final maturity of the account</li>
            <li>The credit union’s books and records are current and reconciled</li>
            <li>The proposed redemption will not jeopardize other current sources of funding, if any, to the credit union, and</li>
            <li>The request to redeem is authorized by resolution of the LICU’s board of directors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The request to redeem discounted secondary capital may be approved in whole or in part.</p>
        <h4>Required Information</h4>
        <p>The Secondary Capital Redemption request must be submitted in writing, specify the increment(s) to be redeemed and the schedule for redeeming any part of the eligible increment, and must demonstrate the LICU can meet the minimum requirements of <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5efdc2bd963a053abc89b66f9af541da&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_134&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.34(d)(1)</a>.</p>
        <p>Credit unions may only redeem secondary capital that is not recognized as net worth under §701.34(c)(2) in accordance with the remaining maturity schedule.</p>
        <h4>Approval Timeframe</h4>
        <p>If a LICU is not notified of approval or denial within 45 days of receipt of a request for approval to redeem, it may proceed to redeem secondary capital as proposed.</p>
        <h4>DOS Initial Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>Within five calendar days of the regional office receiving the SCR, DOS will perform a cursory review to determine whether the request meets the minimum requirements of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5efdc2bd963a053abc89b66f9af541da&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_134&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.34(d)(1)</a>.</p>
        <p>If the SCR is considered <b>incomplete</b>, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact the credit union to obtain the missing information, or</li>
            <li>Prepare an incomplete or denial letter and send it to the credit union by the region’s preferred expedited mail delivery, and copy the examiner, supervisory examiner, and SSA&#160;(if applicable)&#160;on the letter<ul><li>Use the Respond to Incomplete Proposed Secondary Capital Redemption template if the Regional Director opts to defer the request. Ensure the letter lists the required information the credit union must submit for the region to reconsider the plan.</li><li>Use the Deny Secondary Capital Redemption template if the Regional Director opts to deny the plan.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the SCR is considered <b>complete</b>, DOS will determine whether the credit union qualifies for streamlined approval.</p>
        <p>To qualify for streamlined approval, the credit union must meet the minimum requirements specified in <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5efdc2bd963a053abc89b66f9af541da&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_134&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.34(d)(1)</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> and the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Composite CAMEL rating of 1 or 2</li>
            <li>The credit union has properly recognized costs and impairments consistent with GAAP</li>
            <li>Net worth trends are stable or growing, and the credit union will have a post-redemption net worth classification of “well capitalized” under <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f7487481e89b2eb482b7ff41baabd9c8&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr702_main_02.tpl" target="_blank">Part 702</a></li>
            <li>The credit union’s post-redemption capital level will remain sufficient relative to any extraordinary risks associated with its financial and operational activities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the federal credit union meets the requirements for streamlined approval, DOS will prepare an <a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Redeem Secondary Capital/Approve Request to Redeem Secondary Capital.docx#appendix6tt">approval letter</a> and send it to the credit union by the region’s preferred expedited mail delivery service. For FISCUs, DOS will send a letter with the Regional Director’s concurrence for approval to the SSA.</p>
        <p>If a credit union does not meet the requirements for streamlined approval, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prepare and send an <a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Redeem Secondary Capital/Acknowledge Request to Redeem Secondary Capital.docx#appendix6rr">acknowledgment letter</a> to the credit union using the region’s preferred expedited mail delivery service (For FISCUs, DOS will copy the SSA on the letter.)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prepare and send a work assignment to the field that includes the credit union’s request, the SCR, supporting documentation, and request a recommendation for approval or denial</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Field Staff Review Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>If assigned, the examiner will evaluate the credit union’s SCR request. After evaluating the SCR request, the examiner will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete a <a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Redeem Secondary Capital/Regional Summary of Request to Redeem Secondary Capital.docx#appendix6ss">Regional Summary</a> to include an approval or denial recommendation</li>
            <li>Draft a letter to approve (or partially approve) or deny the request using the appropriate template<ul><li><a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Redeem Secondary Capital/Approve Request to Redeem Secondary Capital.docx" target="_blank">Approve Request to Redeem Secondary Capital</a></li><li><a href="../../../Resources/APP-RegulatoryWaivers/Secondary Capital/Redeem Secondary Capital/Deny Request to Redeem Secondary Capital.docx" target="_blank">Deny Request to Redeem Secondary Capital</a></li></ul></li>
            <li>Email the letter, the Regional Summary, and any supporting documentation to their supervisor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The supervisor will review the information, provide supporting reasons for concurrence or non-concurrence, and forward the package to the region’s DOS mailbox.</p>
        <h4>DOS Processing and Review Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>Upon receipt of the examiner’s recommendation, DOS will review and analyze the recommendation for appropriate support and justification.</p>
        <p>If DOS and/or the Regional Director do not agree with the field recommendation, the reasons for the different conclusion will be discussed with the field supervisor. The field will be given the opportunity to further support or revise their recommendation.</p>
        <p>DOS finalizes the response letter for the Regional Director’s signature. For federal credit unions, DOS will mail the signed letter to the credit union using the region’s preferred expedited mail delivery service and copy both the examiner and supervisor.</p>
        <p>For FISCUs, DOS will send a letter with the Regional Director’s concurrence for approval to the SSA.  In the case of disapproval, DOS will send a letter with the Regional Director’s disapproval to both the SSA and the credit union.</p>
