            <MadCap:concept term="RegulatoryWaivers" />Secondary Capital</h2>
        <p>Section 107(6) of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/FCUAct.flsnp" /> authorizes federal credit unions serving predominantly low-income members to receive shares, share drafts and share certificates from non-members. In order to use this authority, a federal credit union must receive a low income designation from its Regional Director. These credit unions are considered low income credit unions. See the NCUA's <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Documents/LowIncomeDesignationFactSheet.pdf" target="_blank">Low Income Designation Fact Sheet</a> for more information on the low-income designation process.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Regs/Pages/Regulations.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a> <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5efdc2bd963a053abc89b66f9af541da&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_134&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.34</a> and <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=e71a90599c0ea75e527e514d5cfd57bd&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.741_1204&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§741.204</a> allow federally insured credit unions designated with low-income status to accept secondary capital accounts from non-natural person members and non-natural person nonmembers subject to certain conditions (see <a href="Secondary_Capital_Plans.htm">Required Information</a>). Increased capital is intended to enable FICUs to support greater lending and improve other financial services for the limited income groups and communities they serve.</p>
        <p>Certain restrictions are placed on these accounts. Foremost is the accounts may be offered only to organizational investors, not to natural person members or other natural person investors. The regulation requires written notice from the LICU and Regional Director approval prior to accepting secondary capital accounts.</p>
