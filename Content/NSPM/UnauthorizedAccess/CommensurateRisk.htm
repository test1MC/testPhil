            <MadCap:concept term="ExamComplaints" />Ensure Supervision Plans are Commensurate with Risk</h1>
        <p>Supervision plans must be commensurate with risk, and will vary based on the circumstances surrounding an incident. The materiality of unauthorized access to member information is based on the risk to members rather than the risk to the share insurance fund. The urgency and scope of the field’s follow-up will coincide with the risk of potential harm to the members affected by a compromise.</p>
        <p>To help determine if supervision are commensurate with risk, field staff should refer to the following decision tree:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/UnauthFlowchart.png" alt="This flowchart outlines how field staff will determine if a supervision plan is commensurate with risk. First, field staff should determine if the incident involved unauthorized access to “sensitive member information,” as defined by the NCUA rules. If it did not, the incident is not subject to Appendix B to Part 748. Field staff should evaluate the supervision plan(s) based on safety and soundness. If the incident did involve unauthorized access to sensitive member information, field staff should determine if the incident presents potential harm to a credit union member or members. If it does not, field staff should evaluate the supervision plans based on safety and soundness, and deferred supervision is acceptable. If the incident does present potential harm to members, field staff should determine if the risk to the member or members is material or not. If the risk is not material, field staff should evaluate the supervision plans based on safety and soundness, and deferred supervision is acceptable. However, if the risk is material, field staff should determine if the credit union has already taken appropriate corrective action or actions. If the credit union has not taken such action, a 60-day follow-up assessment is required. If the credit union has taken such action, field staff should evaluate the supervision plan(s) based on safety and soundness, and deferred supervision is acceptable."

        <p class="ShadedBox">If a notification indicates there has been unauthorized access to sensitive member information and appropriate corrective actions have not been executed or planned, field staff must alter supervision plans to conduct a follow-up assessment within 60 days and report the results of the review to the regional office.<br />When evaluating supervision plans based on safety and soundness, if the risk to a credit union is deemed material, more immediate supervision must be scheduled. This is the case even if a credit union has outlined plans to respond to the incident.  If the risk is not material from a safety and soundness perspective, follow-up may be deferred to a later date such as the next scheduled examination or supervision contact (onsite or offsite).</p>
        <p>DOS will recommend changes to supervision plans based on the information provided in a notification. DOS should consult with specialists, such as RISOs, for assistance on complex matters as needed.</p>
        <p>Field staff will further assess the effectiveness of the credit union’s response plan in relation to the risk of potential harm to the members, and DOS’s recommended supervision plans. Field staff should also utilize specialist assistance on complex matters as needed, following regional procedures accordingly.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, DOS and field staff should come to an agreement on what constitutes appropriate supervision plans after a notification is received. In the event that DOS and field staff do not agree on supervision plans, DOS will escalate the matter to the ARDP (or ARDO for Special Actions cases), who will evaluate the appropriateness and timeliness of supervision plans. Each region will also establish monitoring procedures for completion of 60 day follow-up reviews and any timeframe extensions granted by the ARDP on an exception basis.</p>
        <p>Given the nature of the incident, the member notification, and the corrective actions planned, field follow-up may be deferred until the next scheduled exam or contact.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"><i>Example</i>: A notification indicates there was an incident involving unauthorized access to sensitive member information, and the credit union is in the preliminary stages of a forensic audit to identify the extent of the breach. It is unclear how many members may have been affected.<br />Supervision plans should be adjusted to actively monitor the situation, and ensure the credit union takes appropriate corrective actions including notifications to affected members. Field follow-up should be completed within 60 days, and the results reported to the regional office.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"><i>Example</i>: A notification indicates an ATM skimmer compromised the plastic cards used at an ATM over the weekend. The credit union has made any members who reported fraudulent transactions whole, notified all affected members of the incident, and plans to close and reissue the affected cards. Until then, enhanced transaction monitoring is already in place.<br />Given the nature of the incident, the member notification, and the corrective actions planned, field follow-up may be deferred until the next scheduled exam or contact. However, review of the credit union’s controls over ATM security, including routine physical inspections, may also be recommended for consideration either via offsite contact or at the next scheduled exam or contact.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"><i>Example</i>: A notification indicates an employee accidentally emailed an auto insurance policy with sensitive member information to the wrong email address. The notification also describes the corrective actions taken including formal notification to the members, additional training for credit union personnel, and providing the affected members with an identity theft protection product.<br />Given the nature of the incident, the member notification, and the corrective actions taken, no changes to supervision plans appear warranted.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"><i>Example</i>:  A notification indicates the credit union’s card processor informed them that cards used at a national retailer may have been compromised. The credit union’s notification also references national media coverage of the retailer’s public announcement on the matter. The credit union notified all members of the incident via their website, and plans to close and reissue the affected cards. Until then, enhanced transaction monitoring is already in place. Given the nature of the incident, the member notification, and the corrective actions planned, field follow-up may be deferred until the next scheduled exam or contact.</p>
