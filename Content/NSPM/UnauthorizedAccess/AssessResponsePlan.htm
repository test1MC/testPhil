            <MadCap:concept term="ExamComplaints" />Assess Response Plan Effectiveness</h1>
        <p>When assessing a credit union’s response plan and any recommended changes to supervision plans, staff should consider the inherent risk of the compromised information, as well as any corrective actions the credit union has taken.</p>
        <p>A notification received at the start of a credit union’s investigation may not contain much information other than the credit union’s discovery of a breach that could negatively impact members. If a notification indicates there is risk of potential harm to a member, but provides little additional information, field staff should recommend altering supervision plans to promptly follow-up on the issue.</p>
        <p>If a notification is received after the credit union has concluded its investigation and implemented corrective actions, a more comprehensive assessment of the credit union’s response plan may be possible, and may result in fewer changes to supervision plans.</p>
