        <p>In practice, the timing and content of notifications of unauthorized access to member information will vary. Some may be provided when a credit union begins its investigation, while others may be provided after a credit union has completed its investigation and has taken corrective actions.</p>
        <p>In general, credit unions will send a notification directly to the regional office. However, if field staff are notified of an incident not otherwise reported by a credit union, they should immediately notify their supervisor and determine whether the notification warrants being forwarded to the regional office. Any notifications of unauthorized access to member information received pursuant to <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=474398da8ed878611bfc85941a859035&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt12.7.748&amp;rgn=div5#ap12.7.748_12.b" target="_blank">Part 748</a> should be forwarded to DOS for processing.</p>
        <p>If the NCUA determines that a credit union has not reported an incident (for example, if the field becomes aware of a media article regarding a breach), the <a href="../../Resources/APP-UnauthAccess/Acknowledge Notification of Unauthorized Access.docx">acknowledgment letter</a> sent to the credit union will include commentary on reviewing the credit union’s information security program and <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-106publ102/html/PLAW-106publ102.htm" target="_blank">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a> compliance at the next examination.</p>
        <p>Once a notification is received, DOS is responsible for coordinating with field staff to <a href="AssessResponsePlan.htm">assess the effectiveness of a credit union’s response plan</a> and for <a href="CommensurateRisk.htm">ensuring supervision plans are commensurate with risk</a>.</p>
