        <p><a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=474398da8ed878611bfc85941a859035&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt12.7.748&amp;rgn=div5#ap12.7.748_12.b" target="_blank">Part 748, Appendix B</a>, of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> requires a credit union to notify the appropriate NCUA Regional Director as soon as possible when it becomes aware of an incident involving unauthorized access to, or use of, sensitive member information. The rule and guidance accompanying the rule call for credit unions to conduct a risk-based evaluation of security breaches, but do not require notice to the NCUA in every instance. NCUA&#160;Legal Opinion Letter 06-0332, <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/Legal/OpinionLetters/OL2006-0332.pdf#search=06-0332" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink">Re: Components of Security Response Program.</a>, clarifies that credit unions are not required to notify the NCUA&#160;if an incident of unauthorized access to member information involves little or no likelihood of harm to the member. Federally insured, state-chartered credit unions must also notify the applicable state supervisory authority in the event of an incident. </p>
        <p>The NCUA reviews notifications received from credit unions to ensure the agency has direct knowledge of any potential issues, and can follow-up (onsite or offsite) on matters appropriately. The procedures in the NSPM provide a framework for assessing the effectiveness of a credit union’s response plan and ensuring supervision plans are commensurate with the risk.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"><i>Member information</i> is defined in <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=2a6c5c73460e2d55a45f1ab9535b98e3&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt12.7.748&amp;rgn=div5#ap12.7.748_12.a" target="_blank">Appendix A of Part 748</a>, and means any record containing nonpublic personal information about a member, whether in paper, electronic, or other form, maintained by or on behalf of a credit union.<br /><br /><i>Sensitive member information</i> means a member's name, address, or telephone number, in conjunction with the member's social security number, driver's license number, account number, credit or debit card number, or a personal identification number or password that would permit access to the member's account. Sensitive member information also includes any combination of components of member information that would allow someone to log onto or access the member's account, such as user name and password or password and account number.</p>
