            <MadCap:concept term="ExamComplaints" />Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
        <h3>Field Staff</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Review notifications forwarded by DOS</li>
            <li>Discuss the incident, the credit union’s corrective actions, and other relevant factors with the assigned supervisor to <a href="AssessResponsePlan.htm">assess the appropriateness of supervision plans</a></li>
            <li>Coordinate mutually agreeable supervision plans with DOS and the ARDP (or ARDO, for Special Actions cases) if warranted</li>
            <li>Execute supervision plans</li>
            <li>If a 60 day follow-up is warranted, document the results of the review in the <a href="../../Resources/APP-UnauthAccess/Regional Summary – Unauthorized Access.docx">Regional Summary</a>, draft the <a href="../../Resources/APP-UnauthAccess/Closing Letter.docx">closing letter</a>, and forward to DOS within 60 days of the original notification date</li>
            <li>For FISCUs, collaborate with the SSA in the assessment of the incident and any changes to supervision plans as warranted</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ShadedBox">Coordination with the SSA will vary, as it depends on the working arrangement with each SSA. For example, some SSAs may review all incidents jointly with the NCUA, while others may defer to the NCUA’s review. After consulting with the SSA, the NCUA may defer follow-up to the SSA, and adjust supervision plans to review the results of the SSA’s contact. However, there may be instances when the SSA has agreed to review an incident, but the NCUA has determined that the complexity of the situation warrants the participation of an NCUA specialist. Overall, the SE is responsible for initial coordination with the SSA on supervision plans.</p>
