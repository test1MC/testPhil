            <MadCap:concept term="CUSOregistry" />Field Staff and Regional Office Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>As part of every RFE and Tier 1 SCUEP exam, field staff will document the review of CUSO information in the AIRES scope workbook and in the AIRES CUSO internal control questionnaire. Specifically, field staff will:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Answer questions 1 through 7(a) in the AIRES CUSO internal control questionnaire.</li>
            <li>Determine if the credit union/CUSO relationships reported in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/CUSORegistry.flsnp" /> are materially accurate. If registration is not current or if there is materially inaccurate information in the registry:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li><b>If the credit union is the whole or majority owner of the CUSO</b>, the examiner should attempt to resolve any CUSO reporting issues/concerns through the credit union. If the credit union/CUSO does not resolve the issue, the examiner will refer the issue to the regional office using the <a href="../../Resources/APP-CUSOreviews/CUSO Registry Reporting Concern.docx">CUSO&#160;Registry Reporting Concern</a> form.<br />The regional office will then use the appropriate template to send a letter to the credit union, CUSO, and any other credit union investors or lenders of record.  The letter will advise credit unions that invest in or lend to the CUSO to immediately stop making additional investments in or loans to the CUSO until the registration record is corrected.</li><li><b>For CUSOs with multiple owners</b>, the examiner should notify the regional office of any CUSO reporting issues/concerns immediately using the <a href="../../Resources/APP-CUSOreviews/CUSO Registry Reporting Concern.docx">CUSO&#160;Registry Reporting Concern</a> form. The regional office will use the appropriate template to contact the CUSO and any credit union investors/lenders of record as soon as possible. The letter will request that the CUSO resolve the reporting issue within 30 calendar days from the initial date of contact. <br />If the CUSO does not resolve the issue, the regional office will use the <a href="../../Resources/APP-CUSOreviews/CUSO Registry Examination Follow-Up.docx">CUSO&#160;Registry Examination Follow-Up template</a> to send a letter to the CUSO and any other credit union investors or lenders of record. The letter will advise credit unions that invest in or lend to the CUSO to immediately stop making additional investments in or loans to the CUSO until the registration record is corrected.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Document the completion of each scope step in the compliance section of the scope workbook. Indicate if any issues were discovered, and document the status of resolution.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="ShadedBox">If an examiner finds that a credit union made a new loan to or investment in a CUSO during a period when the CUSO was not properly registered, this should be reported as an Examiner Finding in the credit union’s Exam Report.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">If an examiner finds that a CUSO is in breach of its contract with respect to registering, the examiner will note this as an Examiner Finding in the credit union’s exam report with a reminder that the credit union may not make any new loans to or investments with the CUSO until it comes into compliance. If the issue is corrected during the course of the examination, the examiner should note this in the Examiner Findings. </p>
        <p>Serious or significant recurring issues should be discussed with your supervisor and may warrant a Document of Resolution or Regional Director Letter. Any recommended enforcement action beyond a DOR or RDL should include consultation with the Office of General Counsel.</p>
        <h3>Additional Regional Office Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Regional offices will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Process <a href="../../Resources/APP-CUSOreviews/CUSO Registry Reporting Concern.docx">CUSO&#160;Registry Reporting Concern</a> forms submitted by field staff</li>
            <li>Notify E&amp;I of any CUSO that fails to comply with reporting requirements</li>
            <li>Coordinate with other regional offices when sending letters to investor/lender credit unions in other regions</li>
        </ul>
