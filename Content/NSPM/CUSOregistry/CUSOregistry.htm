            <MadCap:concept term="CUSOregistry" />CUSO&#160;Registry</h2>
        <p>In November 2013, the NCUA issued a <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/Resources/Documents/Encl_CUSO_Final Rule2_112113.pdf" target="_blank">final rule</a> affecting the relationship between credit unions and credit union service organizations. The Board subsequently issued <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Documents/Regulations/FIR20150430CorporateCUs.pdf" target="_blank">changes to corporate credit union rules</a> to require the same reporting for CUSOs that have a loan or investment from a corporate credit union.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9db4a84561f65ce8db06bc63a44ab6a9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt12.7.712&amp;rgn=div5" target="_blank">Part 712</a> and <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9db4a84561f65ce8db06bc63a44ab6a9&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.741_1222&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§741.222</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> apply to all federally insured credit unions that have an investment in, or loan to, a CUSO.

<a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=90e586a0e3f5ac2771f9665c8c143274&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.712_13&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">Section 712.3(d)(4)</a> requires CUSOs to agree, in writing, to provide information to the NCUA and the appropriate SSA, if applicable, on an annual basis. </p>
        <p>The NCUA established the online <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/CUSORegistry.flsnp" /> as the official reporting tool for CUSOs, which will report year-end information to the agency through the registry during an annual registration period (February 1 through March 31). 

The goal of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/CUSORegistry.flsnp" /> is to obtain accurate information about CUSOs in order to effectively evaluate potential financial and operational risk to credit unions.  This information also helps the NCUA identify inter-relationships between credit unions and the CUSOs in which they invest, lend, and do business.  As a result, it is imperative that information contained the registry is accurate.
