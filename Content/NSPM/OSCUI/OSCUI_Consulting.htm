            <MadCap:concept term="OSCUI" />OSCUI Consulting</h1>
        <p>In December 2004, the NCUA Board created the Office of Small Credit Union Initiatives to focus on providing guidance, assistance, and information on development opportunities to small, new, Minority Depository Institutions, and low-income designated credit unions nationwide. OSCUI’s goal is to ensure the long-term viability and growth of these credit unions through four primary programs:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Delivering training to credit union staff and officials at in-person workshops, leadership boot camps, videos, and webinars</li>
            <li>Fostering partnerships and outreach opportunities between credit unions, governmental entities, community-based organizations, and the credit union industry to help identify external programs and services that help credit unions meet their members’ needs</li>
            <li>Providing financial assistance in the form of grants and loans to low-income designated credit unions from the NCUA’s Community Development Revolving Loan Fund administered by OSCUI and funded by Congress</li>
            <li>Providing operational and strategic management consulting services to small credit unions and MDIs enrolled in the consulting program through OSCUI’s staff of economic development specialists</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After consultation with their SE, examiners may contact OSCUI at <a href="mailto:oscuimail@ncua.gov">oscuimail@ncua.gov</a> for additional information on training, partnership and outreach programs, and loans and grants.</p>
