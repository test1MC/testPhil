        <h2>Removal from Consulting Program</h2>
        <p>Credit unions are automatically removed from the consulting program when the assignment is complete or the end of the assigned consulting cycle, whichever comes first.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="OSCUI" />Credit unions that are uncooperative or no longer desire EDS assistance will be removed from the program once the appropriate regional DOS has been notified. This action does not prevent the credit union from future participation in the OSCUI consulting program when circumstances change.</p>
