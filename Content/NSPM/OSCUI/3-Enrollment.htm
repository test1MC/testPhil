            <MadCap:concept term="OSCUI" />OSCUI Consulting Program Enrollment</h2>
        <h3>Standard Enrollment</h3>
        <p>OSCUI relies on a nomination process for enrollment in the consulting program. Nominations can be made by NCUA staff, state regulators, or directly by the credit union (self-nomination) using the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/OSCUI/Documents/ConsultNomination.pdf" target="_blank">OSCUI Consulting Nomination Form</a>. </p>
        <p>The consulting program runs on a semiannual schedule. Nomination forms received by November 30 are considered for the January – June consulting cycle; forms received by May 31 are considered for the July – December consulting cycle. Credit unions not selected for the consulting program are eligible to reapply for future consulting cycles.</p>
        <p>Enrollment is based on available resources and priority ranking. OSCUI will focus its consulting efforts on credit unions that will benefit from the effort. Credit unions that have sufficient resources to pay for consultants and those credit unions that are unsustainable will not be enrolled.</p>
        <p>All nominated credit unions will be notified by OSCUI of their enrollment status via email. Credit unions accepted for enrollment in the consulting program will be notified of the enrollment status as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">OSCUI sends notification emails within five days to the examiner, supervisory examiner, regional DOS and EDS, providing the name of the EDS assigned to each enrolled credit union</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The assigned EDS will contact each enrolled credit union within the first ten business days of the six-month service period (January or July)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Further details regarding the enrollment and selection processes are outlined in NCUA Instruction 6054 (Rev 3), <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Directives/Instructions/6054 (Rev 3).pdf" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink">OSCUI Consulting Program</a> , and on the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/OSCUI/ConsultingForm" target="_blank">OSCUI Consulting Nomination Form</a>.</p>
        <h3>Non-Competitive Enrollment</h3>
        <p>There are a few exceptions to the standard enrollment process. Enrollment is non-competitive in these specific situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">NWRP assistance requests from credit unions with less than $10 million in assets</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Requests to assist new charter organizing groups which have an Office of Consumer Financial Protection-approved field of membership</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Credit unions chartered in the past three years</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Urgent need requests</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nominations for non-competitive enrollment are also made using the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/OSCUI/ConsultingForm" target="_blank">OSCUI Consulting Nomination Form</a>.</p>
        <p>OSCUI may contact regions and OCFP to determine the viability of the non-competitive nominee. Credit unions accepted on a non-competitive basis will be notified of their enrollment status via email by the OSCUI director.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">"Urgent"&#160;needs are unanticipated events such as a natural disaster, loss of key staff, or loss of sponsor support. A drop in CAMEL&#160;ratings does not quality as an urgent need.<br /></p>
