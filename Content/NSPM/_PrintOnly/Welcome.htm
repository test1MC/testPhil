        <h1 class="h1NOautonumber" MadCap:autonum="">Introduction</h1>
        <p>The National Supervision Policy Manual (NSPM) establishes national policies, procedures, and guidelines for effective district management, supervision of credit unions, and quality assurance. Promoting the consistent application of the examination procedures outlined in the NSPM, and vetting and coordinating across the agency the need for any additional examination policies and procedures furthers its purpose.</p>
        <p>While supervisors have the right and responsibility to assign work and manage staff, they should not institute new or additional standard operating procedures, a practice often referred to as "layering." Implementing additional procedures that apply to all examiners in an SE group or field office, or establishing general policy that is narrower than national guidance, is not appropriate. On a case-by-case basis, supervisors can and should implement procedures to manage risk in specific credit unions and/or address the development needs of individual employees.</p>
        <p>Adoption by field offices or supervisors of any alternative or additional examination policies, procedures, or directives beyond what is addressed in the NSPM and other national guidance must be cleared through the Exam Steering Group and the Office of Examination and Insurance (E&amp;I). The Exam Steering Group will review and evaluate field office and/or SE level specific practices to determine if they require E&amp;I approval.</p>
