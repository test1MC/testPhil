            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Develop and Issue Guidance</h3>
        <p>The NCUA issues formal examination and supervision guidance to staff in the form of Supervisory Letters, Regulatory Alerts, and Letters to Credit Unions.  To ensure guidance aligns with the agency’s mission and provides staff appropriate and timely guidance, the NCUA&#160;has adopted a standard process to initiate, develop, and release examination- and supervision-related guidance at the national and field office levels.</p>
        <p>The Office of Examination and Insurance issues authoritative agency guidance at the national level. Individual field offices may issue explanatory and training materials (such as white papers) directly to their staff. The NCUA&#160;Exam Steering Group assists E&amp;I&#160;by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reviewing examination and supervision guidance requests</li>
            <li>Helping prioritize guidance requests based on need</li>
            <li>Recommending a lead office or region responsible for the development of guidance</li>
            <li>Aiding the coordination of necessary resources for guidance development</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ShadedBox"><b>Whitepapers and other regional materials may not establish exam procedures or policy.</b> Regions may continue to provide guidance to staff to clarify existing policy and provide regional specific direction/training.</p>
        <p>The following review process, which is also available on the <a href="http://ncuacentral/Special Projects/ESG/default.aspx" target="_blank">ESG SharePoint site</a>, is intended to eliminate redundant guidance development efforts.  Staff will adhere to the protocol outlined below.</p>
        <h4>Initiating Guidance Development</h4>
        <p>To initiate a request for guidance development, field and central offices will submit a guidance request to E&amp;I and provide a brief description of the issue(s) or topic(s) to be addressed. Upon receiving a formal request for guidance development, E&amp;I will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain an inventory of all guidance products in development and related requests</li>
            <li>Post the inventory of guidance in development to the <a href="http://ncuacentral/Special Projects/ESG/default.aspx" target="_blank">ESG SharePoint site</a></li>
            <li>Provide the formal request to the ESG for discussion</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At each quarterly meeting, the ESG will review all proposed guidance requests received since the last meeting to determine if the proposal creates new agency policy and consider the most appropriate avenue for distribution (Supervisory Letter, Regulatory Alert, Letter to Credit Unions, whitepaper).</p>
        <h4>Developing and Issuing National Guidance</h4>
        <p>Once the ESG (with E&amp;I’s concurrence) or E&amp;I&#160;determines whether the proposed guidance is suitable for national development and issuance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>E&amp;I will notify the requesting office within 14 days of the ESG’s decision.</li>
            <li>Unless E&amp;I will serve as the lead office, another office may volunteer and be assigned as the lead office to conduct the initial research for, and drafting of, the guidance.</li>
            <li>E&amp;I will assign a staff member to be the point of contact on all guidance in development and will work with regions and offices to marshal subject matter experts as necessary.</li>
            <li>Once developed, the lead office will provide all regions and related central offices with the draft guidance and a comment log.  The lead office will establish a comment period no shorter than two weeks for regions and offices to submit feedback.</li>
            <li>The lead office will submit updated guidance to E&amp;I&#160;after receiving and addressing all feedback. A copy of the comment log will be included with the submission.</li>
            <li>E&amp;I will assume the lead at this point and will take on responsibility to perform quality control and vet the guidance with the NCUA Board, Executive Director, other agencies as applicable, and determine whether to issue the guidance, and when.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Developing and Issuing Field Office Guidance (Directions, Training Material, Whitepapers)</h4>
        <p>If  the ESG (with E&amp;I’s concurrence) determines the proposed guidance is suitable for development and issuance by an individual field office:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>E&amp;I will notify the requesting office (the “lead office”) responsible for developing the guidance within 14 days of the ESG's decision.</li>
            <li>Upon notification, the lead office will research, draft, and distribute the material to its staff and provide a copy to all regions, E&amp;I, and any interested central offices.</li>
        </ul>
