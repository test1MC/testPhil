            <h2>Administrative Actions for Troubled Credit Unions</h2>
            <p>Regions will issue a PWL or LUA to all CAMEL 4 and 5 credit unions unless a more formal administrative action is approved (see Supervisory Letter 10-4, <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Letters/Supervisory Letters/SL 10-4.pdf" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink">Administrative Remedies</a>, for more information). Examiners will work through their supervisor and regional office for LUAs, PWLs, or other administrative actions as described in <a href="../AdminRemedies/AdminRemedies.htm#_Chapter_11_–">the Administrative Remedies section of the NSPM</a>.</p>
            <p>The ARDP or ARDO documents, in writing, why a PWL or LUA is otherwise unnecessary; this documentation is included in the administrative record. Examiners will document their recommendation regarding the need for a PWL or LUA in the Confidential Section, as well as the ARDP/ARDO decision.</p>
            <p>Regions may use enforcement actions as warranted to prevent material concerns from threatening the viability of credit unions coded a CAMEL 1, 2, or 3.</p>
