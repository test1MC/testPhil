            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Call Report, Trending Analysis, and RATE</h2>
        <p>The trending process is a means to identify and evaluate existing or emerging risk, highlight supervision needs, adjust supervision plans if necessary, and provide for a more effective allocation of examiner resources. The trending process is an integral part of the examiner’s offsite supervision process and overall district management. Because examinations and onsite supervision contacts are performed at a specific point in time, offsite supervision provides for an ongoing awareness to any changing financial conditions, risk indicators, and/or emerging risks that may be developing in an examiner’s assigned district(s).</p>
        <p>The time examiners charge for data collection, validation, FPR review, risk report analysis, scoping, and trending changes for their districts (WCC 20 or WCC&#160;21) should generally fall within the guidelines specified in the applicable Resource Budget Program:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When the NCUA processes the Call Report: Two hours per cycle for each FICU</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When the NCUA does not process the Call Report:&#160;One hour per cycle per FICU</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examiners should use their discretion in charging the time allotted between uploading the Call Report and performing the risk review. Examiners should contact their supervisor if additional time is needed for the Call Report Risk Review process. Supervisors should approve additional time if the credit union profile warrants additional supervision hours.</p>
