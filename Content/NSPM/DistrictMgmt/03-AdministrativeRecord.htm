            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Administrative Record</h2>
        <p>Examiners will ensure the administrative record documents their concerns about the credit union. Examiners must compile the administrative record through AIRES examination/supervision contact reports or other written communications to the officials. The administrative record is the total collection of information needed for decision-making purposes. The administrative record must present a complete, factual, and fully documented history of the credit union's problems. The administrative record should also clearly document the efforts taken (or not taken) by both the credit union officials and the NCUA to resolve those problems.</p>
