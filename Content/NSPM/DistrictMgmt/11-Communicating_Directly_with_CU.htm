            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Communicating Directly with a Credit Union</h2>
        <h3>Informal Communication</h3>
        <p>Examiners may use e-mail as an informal means of communication with credit unions in place of, or in addition to, telephone calls. Examiners must use ZixMail, the NCUA’s secure e-mail program, when discussing confidential matters with credit unions through email.  Instructions for using ZixMail are available in the NCUA’s <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/IT Info/Hi-Tech 2015 Handbook.pdf" target="_blank"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/HiTechManual.flsnp" /></a> under Outlook 2010.</p>
        <p>Examiners may not share information obtained from a credit union with another credit union (for example, sample policies, etc.) without the originator’s express permission. In addition, examiners will not forward regional/central office email correspondence directly to the credit union.</p>
        <h3>Formal Communication</h3>
        <p>Formal written communication with a credit union is typically initiated by the examiner and supervisor and processed through the regional office. The <a href="../AuditsRecordkeeping/00-Audits_Recordkeeping.htm">Audits, Recordkeeping, and Fraud</a> and <a href="../RegulatoryWaivers/Regulatory_Waivers.htm">Regulatory Waivers and other Regulatory Actions</a> sections of the NSPM&#160;present common types of written correspondence. These sections provide many templates which contain the minimum documentation standards and should be used as a starting point when preparing credit union correspondence. Employees can also reference the <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Human Resources/Communication Manual/NCUA Communications Manual (12-2014).pdf" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink"><a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Human Resources/Communication Manual/NCUA Communications Manual (12-2014).pdf" target="_blank">NCUA Communications Manual</a></a> for more information.</p>

            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">In most cases, the Regional Director’s response is addressed to the board of director's chairperson at the credit union’s address, with a copy to the CEO as appropriate. Correspondence is not typically mailed directly to the home of a board member unless there has been a problem with the correspondence being delivered (for example, there is a question of confidentiality, or, if appropriate, in some cases of negative correspondence such as a Regional Director letter for significant violations or safety and soundness issues). When mailing items to the home address of any board member, the outgoing correspondence should be marked “confidential and private”. In special cases, DOS may mail correspondence to each board member’s home or the supervisor may determine if delivering the correspondence in person is appropriate.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Examiners and supervisors should be copied on all outgoing correspondence. The SSA should be copied on all outgoing FISCU correspondence.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">DOS has the discretion to add line items such as "cc" and "bcc" recipients, “sent via FedEx – Signature Required,” etc. to templates</li>
