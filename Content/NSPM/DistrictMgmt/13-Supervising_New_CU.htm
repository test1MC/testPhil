        <p>If an examiner is responsible for a new credit union, the following policies apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Contact the credit union officials shortly after approval of the charter in order to arrange for the initial examination (usually within the first six months of operation)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Perform a supervision contact within 60 days of initial operations, and within every 120 days thereafter for the first two years</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Documentation requirements are the same as for follow-up examinations</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Maintain open communication with the assigned economic development specialist (EDS)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document compliance with the Letter of Understanding and Agreement (LUA) or Special Insuring Agreement (SIA) and adherence to the credit union’s business plan in the Status Update section of the report</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Review all changes in management (officials and key personnel), and determine if changes in officials were approved by the Regional Director and the SSA, if applicable, in accordance with <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=544e4aa5b1ee15e7bb17000824e5346d&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14e</a> of <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Regs/Pages/Regulations.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Assess the need for assistance, including enrollment in the National Small Credit Union Program (NSCUP), and the creation of a mentor relationship with an established credit union</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Discuss findings and recommendations with management during a joint conference and deliver the appropriate sections of the report to the responsible officials</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The supervisor will provide a summary of the supervision provided, results achieved, and the prognosis for continued successful operations in the regional monthly management report.</p>
