            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />District Management</h1>
        <p>District management encompasses the comprehensive objective of managing and maintaining continuous and detailed knowledge of an assigned district of credit unions. This includes ongoing financial analysis, knowledge of local economic condition, knowledge of current events affecting assigned credit unions, identification of emerging risks, and the routine reporting to management on these issues. The ongoing reevaluation of supervision plans based on this analysis is needed to effectively match resources to risks.</p>
        <p>District management also includes the scheduling, the prioritizing, and the administrative tasks associated with the examiner position. Examiners are responsible for effectively managing risk within their districts by scheduling examinations/supervision contacts based on current and emerging risks. Examiners will document supervision and keep their supervisor apprised of any significant issues affecting their ability to provide adequate supervision to assigned credit unions. Effective district management includes the collaboration of examiners, supervisors, regional offices, and the central office to provide risk-focused supervision and mitigate losses to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (share insurance fund).</p>
