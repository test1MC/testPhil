            <h2>Supervision Chronology Report</h2>
            <p>At a minimum, Supervision Chronology Reports are required for CAMEL 3 Federally Insured Credit Unions (FICUs) with assets $250 million and greater, CAMEL 4 or 5 FICUs, and credit unions requiring a 60 day follow-up for significant recordkeeping concerns. Field staff should document a detailed historical sequence of all issues relating to the supervision of the credit union in the <a href="../../Resources/APP-DistrictMgmt/Supervision Chronology Report.docx#appendix1a">Supervision Chronology Report</a> and include the report in each subsequent upload until it is no longer required. Such items include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All contacts performed at the credit union (for example, examinations, insurance reviews, follow-up examinations, offsite supervision, etc.) subsequent to the credit union triggering a required chronology report</li>
                <li>Correspondence sent to or received from the credit union</li>
                <li>Telephone calls or email correspondence to and from the credit union</li>
                <li>Any significant conversation which could later be important to the administrative record</li>
                <li>Ongoing correspondence for credit unions with identified recordkeeping issues</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Field staff will maintain the Supervision Chronology Report and send to their SE and/or regional office as requested by the SE or regional office. The Supervision Chronology Report is in addition to other reports which may be required to build an administrative record.</p>
            <p class="ShadedBox">When a supervision chronology report is required, field staff must complete the report when upgrading a credit union from a CAMEL 4 or 5, or removing an LUA. </p>
