            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />AIRES File Size Limitation</h3>
        <p>The NCUA limits the size of attachments in Microsoft Outlook to 30MB for internal email. (SSA examiners who do not use an NCUA.gov mailbox are limited to 15MB.)</p>
        <p>If an examiner cannot upload an AIRES file due to the size limitation, they should contact the OCIO help desk as early as possible. OCIO will work with the examiner to allow the file to be uploaded, which may require decreasing the file size while preserving the history and integrity of the exam/supervision information.</p>
