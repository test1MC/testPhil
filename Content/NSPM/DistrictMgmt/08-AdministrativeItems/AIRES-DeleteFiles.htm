            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Deleting AIRES Files</h3>
        <p>To delete a previously uploaded AIRES examination/supervision contact, an examiner will send a request to his or her SE, who is responsible for reviewing the request. The request must include the credit union’s charter number, effective date, contact type, and a brief explanation.</p>
        <p>The SE will forward approved requests to the region’s DOS mailbox and copy the requesting examiner. DOS will notify the supervisor and examiner when the contact has been deleted, and indicate when the examiner will be able to re-upload.</p>
