            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Electronic and Hard Copy Field Files</h3>
        <p>Examiners will maintain electronic field files for credit unions within their district. Examiners will maintain electronic correspondence between the central office, regional office, credit union, SSA, or any other related party within the electronic files. Upon transferring credit unions to another district, examiners will be responsible for transferring the credit union’s electronic files to the new examiner.</p>
        <p>If an examiner chooses to maintain hard copy field files, the examiner is responsible for maintaining the field files in accordance with NCUA Instruction 13500.09, <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Directives/Instructions and Bulletins/13500.09 (Rev 1).pdf" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink">Security of External Party’s Documentation</a>, and NCUA Instruction 1200.15, <a href="http://ncuacentral/OGC/privacy/Shared Documents/1200.15-Safeguarding PII.pdf" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink">Rules and Consequences for Safeguarding Personally Identifiable Information</a>. The field file should not contain confidential or sensitive information, unless properly secured to prevent disclosure to unauthorized parties. The contents of the field file are subject to examiner discretion. In some instances, the credit union may not have any significant problems and there may not be a field file.</p>
