            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Examination/Supervision Completion Date and AIRES Upload Requirements</h3>
        <p>Examiners will enter the examination completion date on the “Completion Information” tab of the EMC in AIRES. The examination/supervision completion date is the day the examiner last charged time to the examination and must be within five business days of the latest of the following dates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Date of last onsite</li>
            <li>Date of exit meeting</li>
            <li>Date of joint conference</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Within one business day of the examination completion date, examiners will upload the AIRES examination report, including a completed Scope.</p>
        <p>The five (5) business days to complete and one business (1) day to upload the examination/supervision contact are included in the <a href="Timeframe_to_Complete_Contact.htm">60-day examination timeframe requirement</a>. For example, if the joint conference, exit meeting, or last day onsite takes place on the 58<sup>th</sup> day, the examiner has two (2) business days to complete and upload the examination.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">The  <a href="Timeframe_to_Complete_Contact.htm">60-day examination timeframe requirement</a> does not include time spent pre-planning (WCC 94 or WCC 95).<br /></p>
        <p>Having a joint conference, exit meeting, or last day onsite on the 58<sup>th</sup> day does not extend the 60-day timeframe unless a waiver is obtained as outlined above. Similarly, if an examiner has the joint conference, exit meeting, or last day onsite on the 30<sup>th</sup> day, she has until the 35<sup>th</sup> business day to complete the examination/supervision contact and until the 36<sup>th</sup> business day to upload the examination/supervision contact. Hand delivery of an examination report does not constitute ‘date last onsite.’</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">The five business days to complete and one business day to upload the examination/supervision contact are included in the 60-day examination timeframe requirement. The 60-day closeout requirement can only be extended through a waiver.<br /></p>
        <p>If the examination completion date exceeds five business days due to items like conferences, training, annual leave, or sick leave, the examiner will document the circumstance(s) in the Confidential Section.</p>
        <p>If there is a delay in the AIRES upload, examiners will notify their supervisor and document supervisor concurrence and the reason(s) for exceeding the timeframe in the Confidential Section of the report.</p>
