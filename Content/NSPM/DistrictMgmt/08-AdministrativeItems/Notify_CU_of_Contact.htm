            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Notifying a Credit Union of an Examination/Supervision Contact</h3>
        <p>When the NCUA&#160;is leading an examination, examiners should provide as much advance notice as possible before starting an examination/supervision contact. Unless <a href="../../DishonestyFraud/00-DishonestFraud.htm">fraud</a> is suspected or other special circumstances exist, examiners will give credit union officials a minimum notice of four weeks. NCUA&#160;management must approve notification periods shorter than four weeks. Each region will specify at what level management approval is required. This approval will be documented in the Confidential Section of the report.</p>
        <p>For <a href="../../FISCUprogram/03-Types_of_FISCU_Exams/Joint_Exam.htm">joint FISCU&#160;exams</a>, the NCUA EIC should make every effort to coordinate with the SSA EIC to ensure that an all-inclusive Items Needed list is provided to the FISCU with as much advance notice as possible. </p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"> NCUA&#160;management must approve notification periods shorter than four weeks.</p>
        <p>As part of the notification process, examiners will provide the appropriate pre-examination letter (RFE or SCUEP) found in the AIRES Exam Directory under Available Template Files.  This letter should be customized to only request items unique and necessary to address the scope and risk profile for each examination.</p>
        <p>Credit unions should receive the Items Needed list no less than four weeks in advance of the actual <a href="../01-Budget_and_Schedule_Exams/Exam_Scheduling_Program.htm">start date</a> of the exam, whether onsite or offsite.  Examiners do not need credit union approval of examination scheduling, but should reach agreement whenever possible to minimize disruption to a credit union and to ensure critical staff members are available while examiners are on site.</p>
        <p>With supervisory approval, examiners may start an examination or supervision contact without providing notice when the EIC plans to conduct a surprise contact due to weak internal controls or when supervisory timeliness is warranted. </p>
