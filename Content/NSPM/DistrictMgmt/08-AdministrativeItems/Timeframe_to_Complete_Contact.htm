            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Timeframe to Complete an Examination/Supervision Contact</h3>
        <p>It is critical to ensure credit union officials receive timely information and take timely corrective action. Examiners will complete and upload all examinations/supervision contacts within 60 calendar days of the start of the examination/supervision contact. The start date is the first date an examiner charges time to <a href="../../WCC/WCCs.htm">WCC</a> 10 or WCC 11 (for an exam), or WCC 22 or WCC 23 (for a supervision contact). An exam start date will coincide with the first date that exam work is conducted onsite or offsite. Examiners must ensure the AIRES start date is consistent with this definition.</p>
        <p>This timeframe includes all other exam-related timeframes. Timeframes detailed in the <a href="Exam_Supervision_Completion_Date.htm">Examination/Supervision Completion Date and AIRES Upload Requirements</a> section of the NSPM&#160;can and will be shortened as necessary to meet the maximum timeframe of 60 days.</p>
        <p>If completing and uploading an examination/supervision contact within 60 days is not possible, an EIC will notify his or her supervisor and obtain approval to extend the timeframe. If the requested completion and upload date exceeds 90 days, the supervisor will notify and request advance approval from the ARDP. Examiners will document the rationale for the extension request and the SE or ARDP decision in the Confidential Section of the report.</p>
        <p>Regions will maintain a cumulative report identifying credit union examinations/supervision contacts remaining open longer than 60 days and provide the report to the ARDPs quarterly. ARDPs will review the report to evaluate if the extended examination periods were justified.</p>
        <p>E&amp;I will evaluate completion and upload timeframes not less than semi-annually to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of examination planning and scheduling.</p>
