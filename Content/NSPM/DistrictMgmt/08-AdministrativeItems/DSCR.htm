            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Documented Secondary CAMEL Review</h3>
        <p>In cases where a credit union presents higher risk, has serious problems, or represents a material potential risk to the share insurance fund, the supervisor that has district responsibility for the credit union will review draft examination and follow-up examination reports before they are finalized by the examiner.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, supervisors will complete a Documented Secondary CAMEL Review for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">All examinations and follow-up examinations of credit unions with assets greater than $250 million at the examination effective date</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">All examinations and follow-up examinations of credit unions with a current or proposed CAMEL rating of 4 or 5</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">All onsite supervision contacts (WCC 22 or WCC 23) where the composite CAMEL rating changes to or from a 4 or 5</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">All examinations and follow-up examinations of credit unions with an NCUA proposed or outstanding <a href="../../AdminRemedies/05-LUA/LUA.htm">LUA</a>, <a href="../../AdminRemedies/06-PWL/PWL.htm">PWL</a>, cease and desist order, or other discretionary supervisory action provided under <a href="../../PCA/PCA.htm">PCA</a></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">All FISCUs with a proposed or outstanding administrative action (equivalent to an <a href="../../AdminRemedies/05-LUA/LUA.htm">LUA</a>, <a href="../../AdminRemedies/06-PWL/PWL.htm">PWL</a>, cease and desist order, or other discretionary supervisory action under <a href="../../PCA/PCA.htm">PCA</a>) issued jointly with or separately by the state regulator where NCUA participates on the examination</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The supervisor’s DSCR must be completed before the examiner releases the final report to the credit union. In the event an examiner is completing work outside his/her SE group, the examiner’s SE will have permissions to view the approved DSCR.</p>
        <p>The supervisor is responsible for reviewing the report to ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The scope is well developed and appropriate for the identified and indicated risks</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">All significant risks and problem areas are appropriately identified and communicated</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Resolution plans are effective and timely for the type and proportion of risk</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">CAMEL and risk ratings appropriately reflect the level and direction of risk</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Recurring problem areas are appropriately escalated to more stringent action plans or administrative actions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For credit unions identified for a DSCR, examiners will email exam support documents to the credit union’s SE for review before issuing the report no more than five business days after completing the field work (including any field work completed by the SSA that the examiner relies on in assigning a CAMEL rating, if applicable). If the five-day timeline cannot be met, the SE may grant the examiner additional time to complete the task. The examiner will document the need for this additional time in the Confidential Section of AIRES.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, examiners must send the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><a href="../../AdminRemedies/03-DOR/DOR.htm">DOR</a> (if applicable)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Examiner’s Findings (if applicable)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">CAMEL Evaluation Form</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Scope module, including completed “Final Assessment” tab</li>
            <li>Any other documents requested by the SE</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examiners must receive the supervisor’s DSCR prior to releasing the exam report to the credit union officials or management. Examiners will document completion of the DSCR in the Confidential Section of AIRES. Examples of sufficient documentation are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>E-mail from the supervisor</li>
            <li>Optional DSCR template in AIRES</li>
            <li>Supervisor creates form to document the review</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Supervisors will perform a CAMEL review and provide the examiner feedback as documented in the DSCR within seven business days of receipt of the supporting documentation. They will evaluate and document the secondary review of CAMEL ratings on the DSCR. In those rare cases where the supervisor and examiner cannot reach consensus on the appropriate CAMEL ratings, the examiner should document the CAMEL ratings they were advised to adjust in the Confidential Section.</p>
