            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Team Member Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Team members are responsible for providing the EIC with the documentation to support any recommendations (and discussed with management) before completing their onsite review. Team members can provide examination materials after completing onsite work only with EIC concurrence and the establishment of a defined delivery date.</p>
        <p>Team memos do not replace a documented scope, applicable questionnaires, and assessment of risk ratings. At a minimum, team members should provide the following to the EIC (as applicable):</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Detail of time charged</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Scope team export file including completed AIRES Scope module (Corporate Exam Work Center for corporate exams), comments on the final risk ratings, and recommended areas for review (when completing the module and areas of review, all team members with an SME designation will include their designation, in parenthesis, next to their initials in the “Done by” column)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Loan Review team export file</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Appropriate questionnaires</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Examiner’s Findings</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document of Resolution (DOR) team export file (include comments in the DOR module on the credit union’s actions to address prior DOR items)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Other work papers to support findings and/or recommended actions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before commencing a team examination or supervision contact which includes three or more team members (including the EIC), the EIC will communicate individual responsibilities and any additional expectations for documentation to all team members, including specialized examiners (RLS, RCMS, RISO, ISO, CMS, etc.). This is typically done through an email or <a href="../../../Resources/APP-DistrictMgmt/Team Memo.docx">team memo</a>. At a minimum, the EIC will provide team members the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Location of the credit union, hours of operation, dress code, travel considerations (rental cars needed, lodging, etc.)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Summary of existing and emerging concerns</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Individual responsibilities and time budgeted</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Expected documentation to be provided to the EIC</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The EIC is ultimately responsible for delegating and coordinating the work of the team members and the quality of the examination. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Risk areas are adequately identified and assessed</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The examination report is cohesive</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Credit union management understands and agrees with the areas of concern</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">An administrative record is well established in AIRES</li>
        </ul>
