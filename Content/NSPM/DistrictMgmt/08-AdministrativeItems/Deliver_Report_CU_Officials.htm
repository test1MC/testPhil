            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Delivering a Report to Credit Union Officials</h3>
        <p>When possible, examiners should deliver the final examination report or insurance review report at the joint conference or exit meeting. For compressed scheduling situations, examiners must deliver the DOR and Examiner’s Findings, if applicable, during the joint conference or exit meeting. Management and key officials should be aware of the major deficiencies before the joint conference. (See the <a href="../10-Joint_Conferences_and_Exit_Meetings.htm">Joint Conferences and Exit Meetings</a> section of the NSPM&#160;for more information.)</p>
        <p>In situations where the examiner is not able to deliver the report at the joint conference or exit meeting, the examiner must mail the report to the credit union within one business day of the examination completion date. If this timeframe cannot be met, the examiner must document supervisor concurrence in the Confidential Section, as well as the reason for delay.</p>
