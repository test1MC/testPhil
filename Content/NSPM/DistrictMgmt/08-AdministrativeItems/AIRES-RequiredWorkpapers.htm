        <h3>
            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Required AIRES&#160;Workpapers and Questionnaires</h3>
        <p>Field staff are responsible for including all questionnaires required by the most recent <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Instruction5000.flsnp" />, as well as work papers, and team memoranda (if applicable), in the AIRES file.</p>
        <p>Appendix 20A of the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/GuidesEtc/Pages/Examiners-Guide.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/ExaminersGuide.flsnp" /></a> lists the required AIRES work papers which must be included in examination uploads. The <a href="../../FCUprogram/00-FCU_Program.htm">FCU&#160;Program and Procedures</a> and <a href="../../FISCUprogram/00-FISCU_Program.htm">FISCU Program and Procedures</a> sections of this guide include documentation requirements for both onsite and offsite contacts. Examiners will include additional work papers completed which contribute to the administrative record including team members’ loan exceptions work papers and documentation submitted for other areas reviewed.</p>
        <p>The AIRES upload file should contain all documentation provided to management in the credit union’s formal exam report and documentation produced by the examiner or exam team participants to support the report. Examiners should generally not include documents provided by the credit union unless the information cannot be effectively documented elsewhere in the AIRES upload file.</p>
        <h4>AIRES&#160;Table of Contents</h4>
        <p>The table of contents serves as the NCUA’s permanent record and documentation as to what was provided to credit union officials. Examiners will use the table of contents to organize the report given to the officials. The table of contents is a required work paper. Examiners are required to print the final copy of the examination report (using the print examination function within AIRES) before creating or uploading their examination file. The AIRES print examination function creates the table of contents in a PDF format and ensures the visibility of the table of contents in the examination upload file.</p>
        <h4>AIRES&#160;Share and Loan Download</h4>
        <p>Examiners are required to request an AIRES share and loan download for every examination. If a credit union will not or cannot provide an AIRES share and loan download, examiners will notify their supervisor while the on-site field work is in process. The SE will work with the examiner on options for obtaining the AIRES download (or an equivalent such as a text file with share and loan information). The examiner should document the options exercised to obtain the download (for example, contacting other credit unions with the same vendor, contacting the vendor directly) and concurrence with the SE on the final outcome in the Confidential Section.</p>
        <h4>Consumer Compliance Violations Module</h4>
        <p>Examiners must document violations of federal regulation detected during the examination and supervision process on the Consumer Compliance Violations module in AIRES. Examiners will follow the procedures for BSA violations outlined in the <a href="../../BSAenforcement/BSA_Enforcement.htm">BSA Enforcement</a> section of the NSPM.</p>
