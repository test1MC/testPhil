            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Joint Conferences and Exit Meetings</h2>
        <p>A joint conference is a meeting of the examiners and a sufficient number (quorum) of the board of directors to conduct official credit union business. It provides the examiner the opportunity to reach agreements with the board that they will take appropriate action for reducing levels of unwarranted risk in the credit union.</p>
        <p>Examiners must hold a joint conference at the end of every examination and follow-up examination for CAMEL 3, 4, and 5 credit unions. In CAMEL 1 or 2 credit unions, a joint conference is not mandatory; however, examiners must make credit unions aware of the option of holding a joint conference by offering a joint conference to the board chair (or their board member designee, not to include a credit union employee) and document the decision in the Confidential Section. The examiner may also elect to hold a joint conference if the examination reveals substantive concerns or there is a need for a communication forum.</p>
        <p>Examiners will conduct an exit meeting at the end of every examination and for any onsite supervision contact that results in a report or other correspondence. (See <a href="../FCUprogram/04-FCU_Supervision_Contacts/Onsite_Supervision_Documentation.htm">Onsite Supervision Contact Documentation</a>.) An exit meeting differs from a joint conference in that an exit meeting does not require a quorum of the board attend. Attendance generally consists of top management, key staff members, and preferably one or more officials (board members or supervisory committee members). When no joint conference is scheduled, examiners should extend an invitation to the board and supervisory committee chairpersons to attend the meeting.  </p>
        <p>The examiner will provide adequate information  to allow recipients to make an informed decision regarding whether any of the officials would like to participate in the exit meeting or have a joint conference. Examiners should make every effort to confirm commitment from management and the officials present at the exit meeting to take corrective action, if necessary.</p>
        <p>If material information arises that has not been presented to managers, field staff may reschedule the joint conference, exit meeting, or release of the examination report until the information is presented, or may conduct a follow-up meeting. Examiners must obtain supervisor approval if they exceed the exam completion parameters addressed in the District Management section of the NSPM.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">Key assertions may be withheld from management in the event they merit discussion directly with a credit union board of directors. An example of such a circumstance is suspected fraud.</p>
