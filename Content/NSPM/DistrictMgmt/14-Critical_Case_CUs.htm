            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Critical Case Credit Unions </h2>
        <p>The term “critical cases” is used to define credit unions which pose the most significant emerging risk to the share insurance fund. Critical case briefings are part of the region’s risk management practices and provide regional management an opportunity to evaluate the need for enhanced supervision. This section provides examiners with insight into the purpose, selection criteria, and processes involved in critical case credit union briefings as well as providing structure on what to expect if critical case credit unions are identified within their district.</p>
