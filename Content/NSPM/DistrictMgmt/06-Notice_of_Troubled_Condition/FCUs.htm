            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Notice of Troubled Condition</h3>
        <p>Examiners must notify a federal credit union which has been newly downgraded to a CAMEL 4 or 5 of the credit union’s troubled status. The examiner may choose to include the forms referenced in the required language below in the exam report, or provide the credit union with the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/GuidesEtc/Pages/Notice-of-Change-in-Official-or-Senior-Executive-Officer.aspx" target="_blank" title="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/GuidesEtc/Pages/Notice-of-Change-in-Official-or-Senior-Executive-Officer.aspx" alt="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/GuidesEtc/Pages/Notice-of-Change-in-Official-or-Senior-Executive-Officer.aspx">specific location of the forms on the NCUA&#160;public website</a> as necessary. The examiner will include the following text in the open section of the report:</p>
        <p>“Your credit union is coded CAMEL 4 [or 5] as a result of this examination (or onsite supervision contact). Therefore, the [Credit Union's Name] Federal Credit Union is now designated in troubled condition per Section 212(f) of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/FCUAct.flsnp" /> and <a href="../../FCUprogram/04-FCU_Supervision_Contacts/Offsite_Supervision.htm#http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d12e68ea1b8687ee31f93aec541af85f&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" />. You must obtain NCUA approval for changes of officials and senior executive officers at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the change, or within 48 hours of election at an annual membership meeting. You can find this information on the NCUA’s website. The procedures remain in effect until the credit union is upgraded to a CAMEL 3 or better.”</p>
        <p>Examiners must notify an FCU which has been newly upgraded from a CAMEL 4 or 5 to a 3 or better that the credit union is no longer considered in troubled condition. This is done by including the following excerpt in the open section of the report:</p>
        <p>“Previously, your credit union received notification it was subject to requirements under <a href="../../FCUprogram/04-FCU_Supervision_Contacts/Offsite_Supervision.htm#http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d12e68ea1b8687ee31f93aec541af85f&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" />. As a result of your credit union’s CAMEL rating upgrade to a CAMEL [enter CAMEL rating of 3, 2, or 1] rating and removal from troubled status, you are no longer required to obtain the NCUA approval for changes of officials and senior executive officers.”</p>
