            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Federally Insured, State-Chartered Credit Unions</h3>
        <p>The NCUA will not designate a FISCU to be in troubled condition without first making an onsite contact at the credit union. A FISCU that has been assigned a 4 or 5 CAMEL composite rating by either the NCUA, after an on-site contact, or its state supervisor, must be notified of its troubled status.</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">NCUA examiners must notify a FISCU which has been newly downgraded to a CAMEL 4 or 5 by the NCUA during a joint examination, onsite contact, or insurance review of the credit union’s troubled status<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">NCUA examiners will include the following language at the top of the FISCU CAMEL Evaluation Form in AIRES: “Your credit union is coded CAMEL 4 [or 5] by the NCUA as a result of this examination [or onsite supervision contact]. Therefore, the [Credit Union's Name] Credit Union is now designated in troubled condition per Section 212(f) of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/FCUAct.flsnp" /> and <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d12e68ea1b8687ee31f93aec541af85f&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" />. You must obtain approval from your state supervisor and the NCUA for changes of officials and senior executive officers at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the change, or within 48 hours of election at an annual membership meeting. You can find this information on the NCUA’s website. The procedures remain in effect until the credit union is upgraded to a CAMEL 3 or better.”</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A FISCU that has been newly downgraded to a CAMEL 4 or 5 as a result of the state supervisor’s rating must be notified of its troubled status. This situation will generally occur when the NCUA does not participate on the examination and the state’s CAMEL rating is a 4 or 5 (regardless of the NCUA’s CAMEL rating on the WCC 26 review); or if the NCUA’s CAMEL rating during a joint examination is a 3 or better while the state’s CAMEL rating is a 4 or 5. In situations where the NCUA did not participate and concludes a FISCUs CAMEL rating is a 4 or 5 during the WCC 26 review (and the state rating is a 3 or better), an onsite contact is required to be completed within 60 days. In such instances, the FISCU will be notified of its troubled status on the CAMEL disclosure issued during the onsite contact and not before.<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">During the <a href="../../FISCUprogram/00-FISCU_Program.htm">required WCC 26 review</a>, NCUA examiners will determine if the FISCU received written notification of its troubled condition by the state supervisor via the examination report, separate letter, or otherwise.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">If notification by the state supervisor cannot be confirmed, the NCUA examiner will draft a letter notifying the FISCU of its troubled status using the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/Notify FISCU of Troubled Condition.docx">Notify FISCU of Troubled Condition</a> template. Once prepared, the letter will be processed for the Regional Director’s signature through the examiner’s supervisor, and the regional office.</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When both the state supervisor and the NCUA have newly upgraded a FISCU to a CAMEL 3 or better, NCUA examiners must notify the FISCU that the credit union is no longer considered in troubled condition. FISCUs are considered troubled based on the CAMEL composite rating by either the state supervisor or the NCUA; this status can only be removed when both the state supervisor and the NCUA upgrade a FISCU’s CAMEL composite rating to a 3 or better as a result of an examination or onsite contact. <ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">NCUA examiners will notify the FISCU by including the following excerpt at the top of the FISCU CAMEL Evaluation Form: “Previously, your credit union received notification it was subject to requirements under <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d12e68ea1b8687ee31f93aec541af85f&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.701_114&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§701.14</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" />. As a result of your credit union’s CAMEL rating upgrade to a CAMEL [enter CAMEL rating of 3, 2, or 1] rating and removal from troubled status, you are no longer required to obtain the NCUA's approval for changes of officials and senior executive officers. Please consult with your state regulator to determine whether you must continue to notify their office of any changes of officials and senior executive officers."</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">In instances where the state regulator is the last to upgrade a FISCU from troubled condition to a CAMEL composite 3 or better and the NCUA does not participate on the examination/contact resulting in the upgrade by the state, NCUA examiners will attempt to verify whether the state supervisor provided the FISCU with written notification of the removal of its troubled status via the examination report, separate letter, or otherwise.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If notification by the state supervisor cannot be confirmed, the NCUA examiner will draft a letter notifying the FISCU of the removal of its troubled status using the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/Upgrade FISCU from Troubled Condition Status.docx">Upgrade FISCU from Troubled Condition Status</a> template.  The letter will be processed for Regional Director signature through the examiner’s supervisor, and the regional office.</li>
