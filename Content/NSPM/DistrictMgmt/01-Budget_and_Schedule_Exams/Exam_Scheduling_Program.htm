            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />NCUA Examination Scheduling Program</h3>
        <p>The NCUA’s examination scheduling program incorporates an extended examination cycle for eligible credit unions. The examination cycle does not limit the NCUA’s authority to examine any federally insured credit union as frequently as the agency deems necessary.  The NCUA will consider financial trends, risks, and other facts or circumstances to determine if a more frequent examination or supervision contact is required. </p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"> The <b>start date for an exam</b> is the first date an examiner charges time to WCC 10 or WCC 11. An exam start date will coincide with the first date that exam work is conducted onsite or offsite. Examiners must ensure the AIRES&#160;start date is consistent with this definition.</p>
        <h4>Federal Credit Unions</h4>
        <p>Examinations for federal credit unions eligible for an extended cycle will begin between 14 and 20 months from the prior examination completion date.  Examinations for all other federal credit unions will begin between 8 and 12 months from the prior examination completion date.  A federal credit union is eligible for an extended examination cycle if it meets all of the following criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CAMEL code 1 or 2, both in composite and management rating components</li>
            <li>Assets less than $1 billion</li>
            <li>“Well capitalized” per prompt corrective action regulations</li>
            <li>No outstanding documents of resolution items related to significant recordkeeping deficiencies, and</li>
            <li>Not operating under a formal or informal enforcement or administrative order, such as a cease and desist order, letter of understanding and agreement, preliminary warning letter, or PCA directive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Small credit unions with limited segregation of duties that are otherwise eligible for an extended exam cycle may receive more frequent examinations on a random sample basis.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"> The CAMEL&#160;criteria is based on the CAMEL&#160;rating in effect at budget time. The criteria for asset size is based on the March 31st Call Report in the preceding calendar year.</p>
        <h4>Federally Insured, State-Chartered Credit Unions</h4>
        <p>FISCUs that meet any one of the following criteria will receive NCUA exams that will begin between 8 and 12 months from the prior exam completion date:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assets greater than $1 billion</li>
            <li>Composite NCUA&#160;CAMEL code 4 or 5 with assets greater than $50 million, or</li>
            <li>Composite NCUA&#160;CAMEL code 3 with assets greater than $250 million</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All other federally insured, state-chartered credit unions will receive an NCUA examination based on risk and emerging trends, including small credit unions with internal control weaknesses, or on a sample basis as part of the agency’s overall due diligence.</p>
        <p>The NCUA will make every effort to conduct examinations of federally insured, state-chartered credit unions jointly with the appropriate state supervisory authority, as long as the time between examinations does not exceed the NCUA's needs as insurer. The NCUA&#160;will only conduct an independent insurance review when a joint examination cannot be coordinated with the state supervisory authority.</p>
        <h4>Corporate Credit Unions</h4>
        <p>All corporate credit unions must be examined once each calendar year, regardless of asset size.  For corporate credit unions, the maximum time between completion dates is 12 months unless the deputy director approves an extension.</p>
