        <h4 MadCap:autonum="1. ">Examiner</h4>
        <p>The budgeting process begins with examiners. Examiners are responsible and accountable for using historical knowledge of the credit union, Management Automated Resource System (MARS), and/or the “Plans and Budget” tab in the Scope module to view previously recommended examination/supervision hours for each district credit union. For a corporate credit union, examiners will use the most recent Agreed Upon Supervision Plan (AUSP) or other historical information.</p>
        <p>Based on this information, examiners will submit recommended estimated hours to their supervisor during the annual resource planning process using the credit union resource allocation module in MARS online ( E&amp;I provides instructions for this process annually).</p>
        <p>Additionally, examiners will recommend specialized resources in consultation with their supervisor when the size, complexity, or potential risk to the share insurance fund warrants the use of specialized expertise (for example, regional office/ONES staff, central office staff, AMAC, outside contractors). Examiners will consult with their supervisor during the year if conditions warrant changes to the examination budget.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="2. ">Supervisor</h4>
        <p>Supervisors are responsible and accountable for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Managing resources on an ongoing basis throughout the year to ensure the proper development of examiners and completion of program including the resolution of risk areas</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Managing  resources to effectively examine large, complex, and problematic institutions</li>
            <li>
                <p>Evaluating the annual budget recommendation for the group after consulting with district examiners</p>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Monitoring and reconciling group budgets monthly using the MARS online system and according to associate regional director of programs (ARDP) direction</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reporting the group program status, variances, and shortfalls to the ARDP monthly, adjust budgets, or request assistance when group resources are not sufficient to complete the examination program or as conditions warrant</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="3. ">Regional Director / ARDP</h4>
        <p>ARDPs are responsible and accountable for managing the regional resources budget and keeping the Regional Directors informed of the status of regional examination/supervision programs. ARDPs will reallocate regional resources and coordinate with associate regional director of operations (ARDO)/ARDPs/Regional Director to secure assistance when group resources are not sufficient. ARDPs will ensure all workload budgets are reconciled by the 15th of each month. Regional Directors will provide quarterly reports to E&amp;I noting the region’s examination program, workload budget, and the status of any shortfalls and/or the identification of any assistance needed.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="4. ">E&amp;I</h4>
        <p>E&amp;I is responsible and accountable for monitoring the successful completion of the national examination and supervision program. E&amp;I will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Periodically and routinely request reports from the regions, allowing sufficient time for regional responses</li>
            <li>Review the status of regional and national program completion and emerging needs</li>
            <li>Assist with resource needs where necessary</li>
            <li>Establish national priorities when conditions warrant ensuring completion of national program goals</li>
            <li> Identify national trends and resource priorities by monitoring appropriate MARS&#160;reports and specialized reports, as well as evaluating quarterly regional workload reports</li>
        </ul>
