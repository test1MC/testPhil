            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Developing a Critical Case List</h3>
        <p>Periodically, regions will develop a listing of their top critical cases. Regional management will select critical cases based on the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Recommendations from regional management and regional DOS</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Quarterly risk trending reports reviewed by regional DOS</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Monthly management reports listing problem cases </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Internal regional risk reports</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <a href="http://reportcentral/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2fHigh+Risk+PipeLine%2fHigh+Risk+Credit+Union+Pipeline+Reports+-+Main+Page" target="_blank">High Risk Credit Union Pipeline Reports</a>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reports provided by E&amp;I flagging select cases</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Other approaches at the discretion of the region</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regional management will compile a critical case list and share the cases with E&amp;I. E&amp;I will review case files and request attendance at selected critical case briefings each year based on critical cases of national significance and to monitor regional risk management approaches.</p>

            <p class="ShadedBox">The High Risk Credit Union Pipeline identifies potential credit union failures and estimates the potential loss for high risk credit unions based on select minimum criteria. It does not cover all the possibilities for a credit union to show up as a critical case. HRP reports can be used as a starting point for the critical case lists, but regions may need to add credit unions to the list as they see fit. <br /><br />Theoretically, any credit union rated as “Likely to Fail” in the HRP should show up on a critical case list. However, the regional office may list a credit union that meets the minimum HRP&#160;Instruction criteria as unlikely to fail. This does not mean regional management cannot consider the credit union as a critical case and monitor it closely.<br /><br />Removing a credit union from the critical case list is not the same as removing it from the HRP. NCUA Instruction 4001, <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Directives/Instructions/4001.pdf" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink">High Risk Credit Union Pipeline</a>, provides specific information regarding the HRP.</p>
