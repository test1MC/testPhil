            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Supervisor Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Supervisors are responsible for managing risks within their groups and mitigating losses to the share insurance fund. Supervisors must ensure examination/supervision contact reports are high quality, results-oriented work products that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Properly identify and rate significant risks</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Assign appropriate CAMEL and risk ratings</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reflect a complete administrative record</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Develop appropriate plans to correct major problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Supervisors are responsible for ensuring that examinations/supervision contacts are scheduled, conducted, and completed appropriately. Supervisors will facilitate scheduling for team examinations and request appropriate specialized resources are provided for institutions representing a significant risk to the share insurance fund.</p>
        <p>Supervisors are also responsible for ensuring examiners complete results-driven supervision and provide the proper level and type of supervision for each credit union. Supervisors will ensure examiners properly schedule supervision contacts, within the appropriate timeframes given the conditions unique to each credit union. Supervisors will ensure extension requests are reasonable and justifiable and will not unduly jeopardize credit union operations or risk to the share insurance fund.</p>
        <p>Supervisors will use a variety of tools (including, but not limited to, MARS, risk reports, Call Reports, and regional reports) to ensure assigned credit unions receive the proper results-oriented supervision on a timely basis. Supervisors will be responsible for reporting on the highest risk credit unions in their group to their regional office on a regular predefined interval using established forms, methodologies, and systems (for example, <a href="http://reportcentral/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2fHigh+Risk+PipeLine%2fHigh+Risk+Credit+Union+Pipeline+Reports+-+Main+Page" target="_blank">High Risk Credit Union Pipeline Reports</a>, critical cases, etc.).</p>
