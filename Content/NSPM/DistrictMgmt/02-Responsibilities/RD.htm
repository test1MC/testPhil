            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Regional Director Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Regional Directors are responsible for mitigating losses to the share insurance fund, identifying emerging risk trends, and taking proactive steps to correct problems. In addition, Regional Directors are responsible for measuring and monitoring the regional examination program for quality and completeness, as well as adherence to established standards including CAMEL and risk ratings. They will work with supervisors to ensure appropriate specialized resources are provided for institutions representing a significant risk to the share insurance fund. Regional Directors will report quarterly to E&amp;I regarding the status of their examination programs including adherence to examination and supervision standards.<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> Until a national database/tool is developed, regions will continue to use reporting systems currently in place. Regions should ensure their current systems capture the requested information.</p></MadCap:footnote><![CDATA[  ]]></p>
        <p>The Regional Director is also responsible for monitoring and evaluating overall supervision efficiency, effectiveness, and timeliness. The Regional Director will monitor supervision efforts through the quality control review process and various available reporting tools, including self-designed monitoring reports. He or she will report on their high-risk credit unions via the monthly management report, <a href="http://reportcentral/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2fHigh+Risk+PipeLine%2fHigh+Risk+Credit+Union+Pipeline+Reports+-+Main+Page" target="_blank">High Risk Credit Union Pipeline Reports</a> (see NCUA Instruction 4001), and other methods as they become available.</p>
