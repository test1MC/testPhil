            <MadCap:concept term="DistrictMgmt" />Confidential Section</h2>
        <p>The Confidential Section of the examination report is for the NCUA’s internal use only. Examiners should use this section to document any actions which take place during the examination that are not discussed elsewhere in the report.</p>
        <p>This section is also the appropriate place to discuss management’s ability and willingness to correct areas of concern, as well as provide details of new or unique programs or services not discussed elsewhere in the report or in the AIRES Scope module.</p>
        <p>Examiners will address the following in the Confidential Section:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Number and type of attendees of the joint conference and/or exit meeting (for example, five board members, one supervisory committee member, SE Smith)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Summary of subjects discussed (outside of what can be found in the open section) at the joint conference or exit meeting including agreements reached and acceptance of the DOR</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reasons management failed to take corrective action for any previous and outstanding DOR items or agreements relating to safety and soundness and/or plans for escalation of administrative action</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Explanation of any CAMEL rating differences or other differences during joint insurance reviews and joint examinations of federally insured state-chartered credit unions (FISCUs)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Any approvals or concurrences from their supervisor or ARDP concerning conditions or actions taken during the examination (i.e., reject audit, no LUA with repeat DOR, issuing a PWL, LUA, EIC rotation exceptions, adjustments in CAMEL ratings, MBL waiver violations not presenting a heightened level of risk, etc.). The examiner will include the reasons for the recommendation, the anticipated date the problems will be resolved, the recommended course of action if the problems are not resolved, and the examiner’s plans for supervision</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Any other pertinent information about management in order to maintain a full administrative record (for example, management’s and officials’ ability to resolve issues, knowledge level of credit union operations, not providing an AIRES download)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Any deviations from budgeted hours, documenting supervisor concurrence</li>
            <li>Any expansion beyond the SCUEP defined-scope procedures, including how and why the scope was expanded, documenting supervisor approval in the <i>Miscellaneous Exam Considerations</i> section (if applicable)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reason why report not completed or uploaded within required timeframes (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Completion of a documented secondary CAMEL review</li>
            <li>Reasons a joint FISCU exam was not possible, including efforts made to coordinate the joint examination with the SSA, when applicable.<ul><li>When a joint exam is conducted, the EIC will note the extent of SSA participation in the Confidential Section.</li></ul></li>
