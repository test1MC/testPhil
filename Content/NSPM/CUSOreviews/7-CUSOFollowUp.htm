        <h3>CUSO Follow-Up Reviews</h3>
        <p>CUSO follow-up reviews can be conducted when directed by the SE, the DSA director or other senior NCUA officials. The EIC conducting the follow up contact will use their discretion in developing both the content and the format of the follow-up review report. However, at a minimum, the follow-up review report will address action taken by the CUSO officials on the recommended corrective actions outlined in the original CUSO review report. </p>
        <p>Once the draft follow-up report is finalized; the EIC will forward a copy of the report to their supervisor for initial review. Upon review and approval, the supervisor will forward the draft follow-up report to DOS Mail.  DOS will log the item and review it within 14 days. The responsible DOS analyst, working with the EIC and the EIC’s supervisor, will review, edit, and clarify the report as necessary.</p>
        <p>Once the follow-up report is finalized, DOS will distribute the review follow-up report in accordance with <a href="6-Distribute_Final_Report.htm">distribution procedures outlined in the NSPM</a> and ensure upload of the final follow-up review report in accordance with the <a href="8-Report_Maintenance.htm">procedures outlined in the NSPM</a>.</p>
