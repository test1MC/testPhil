            <MadCap:concept term="CUSOreviews" />CUSO Review Report Maintenance</h2>
        <p>E&amp;I will maintain a <a href="http://ncuacentral/EANDI/ExamSystems/CUSODocs/CUSOList.aspx" target="_blank">CUSO SharePoint site</a>, which will serve as the central repository for all agency CUSO reviews. E&amp;I will organize CUSO reviews by EIN numbers, and will identify CUSOs by name for ease of reference.</p>
        <p>Once regional DOS has distributed the final CUSO review report, DOS staff will upload a compressed file (zip file) of the review to the CUSO SharePoint site and send an email to <a href="mailto:eimail@ncua.gov">_E&amp;I Mail</a> and to all other regional DOS mailboxes to alert them to the upload.</p>
        <p>To ensure consistency, regional DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zip all CUSO review files so that only one file for each separate CUSO review is uploaded to the system</li>
            <li>Name the zip file as follows: YYYYMM_EIN, where ‘YYYYMM’ is the effective date (for example, a CUSO with an EIN of 987654 and an examination effective date of June 30, 2014 would be named 201406_987654.zip)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is imperative that EINs are accurate, since the EIN is the primary identifier for the CUSO. DOS will upload the zip file to the appropriate EIN folder or create a new folder using the CUSO EIN if one does not already exist. For example, a CUSO with an EIN of 987654 would have a folder identified as 987654 (with no other characters in the name). All CUSO reviews will be housed in a folder using the EIN.</p>
        <p>E&amp;I DOS staff will amend the master EIN/CUSO list if necessary and ensure appropriate links are maintained to actual CUSO files within seven days of receiving notification of an upload.</p>
