            <MadCap:concept term="CUSOreviews" />Distributing a Draft Review Report</h2>
        <p>The EIC will forward the draft CUSO&#160;review package to their supervisor for initial review. At a minimum, the CUSO&#160;review package will include the CUSO&#160;Review report (including any attachments and appendices) and the Confidential Section. Upon review and approval, the supervisor will forward the draft report to DOS Mail; DOS will log the item and review it within 14 days. The responsible DOS analyst, working with the EIC and the EIC’s supervisor, will review, edit, and clarify the report as necessary.</p>
        <p>Once the draft report has been reviewed by DOS and agreed-upon changes have been made, the DOS analyst will mark the report “Draft” and send it to any SSA that participated in the on-site review. The DOS analyst will not provide the draft report for comment to any SSA that did not participate in the review.</p>
        <p>The DOS analyst will use the <a href="../../Resources/APP-CUSOreviews/Draft Report Cover Letter to SSA.docx">Draft Report Cover Letter to SSA</a> template to develop a draft report transmittal letter to the SSA. The letter establishes a 15-day response date, and indicates that the NCUA will assume the SSA accepts draft report content as provided if a response is not provided within 15 days. The DOS analyst working with the EIC will revise the draft report based on any SSA responses provided.</p>
        <p>Once SSA comments are received and incorporated into the draft report by DOS (or if no SSA participated in the review), the DOS analyst will send a copy of the draft report to CUSO management. The DOS analyst will use the <a href="../../Resources/APP-CUSOreviews/Draft Report Cover Letter to CUSO.docx">Draft Report Cover Letter to CUSO</a> template to create a transmittal letter for the draft report. This letter will request CUSO management provide comments regarding review content and responses to all findings and recommended corrective actions within 15 days of receipt.</p>
        <h3>Management Response</h3>
        <p>DOS analysts will forward a copy of any CUSO management responses to the draft report on to the EIC. The EIC will review the responses within ten days of receipt to determine if they are sufficient to address all concerns.&#160; The EIC, DOS analyst, and SSA staff (if applicable) will coordinate with CUSO management regarding the responses as necessary.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">If a CUSO is unable or unwilling to respond to the NCUA, the agency will issue the report and include an indication that the CUSO did not provide a response. The EIC will work with CUSO management to a reasonable extent to ensure the sufficiency of management’s response. If no agreement can be reached, the finalization and distribution of the report will be handled on a case-by-case basis in consultation with regional management.</p>
        <p>Once the EIC and DOS analyst agree on the adequacy of management’s responses, the DOS analyst will add management’s responses to the appropriate response section of the <a href="../../Resources/APP-CUSOreviews/CUSO Review Report Template.docx">CUSO Review Report</a>. Once the final report has been updated with management responses, the DOS analyst will provide a copy to the EIC and coordinate with the EIC to determine whether a management conference will be held with CUSO officials.</p>
