            <MadCap:concept term="CUSOreviews" />State Supervisory Authorities &amp; CUSO Reviews</h2>
        <p>CUSO reviews may be performed jointly with an SSA or independently by an SSA. For joint reviews, the agency that initiates the review is typically in charge of the review.</p>
        <p>SSAs may conduct CUSO reviews and issue CUSO review reports independently, and may provide a copy of the review report directly to the NCUA regional offices.</p>
        <p>For independent SSA CUSO review reports, a DOS analyst will prepare a summary of the report outlining areas of concern and any conclusions based on the report. The depth and breadth of this review will depend on the nature of the CUSO.</p>
        <p>DOS will route their review comments and a copy of the SSA report to the DOS Director, Regional Director, ARDO, and the ARDP for comments. The DOS analyst will ensure the review report and comments are posted to the <a href="http://ncuacentral/EANDI/ExamSystems/CUSODocs/CUSOList.aspx" target="_blank">CUSO SharePoint site</a> in the same manner as a review completed by the NCUA within 30 days of receipt. In addition the DOS analyst will provide a copy of the final SSA report and summary to regional SEs and DSAs.</p>
