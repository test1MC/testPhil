            <MadCap:concept term="CUSOreviews" />Selecting, Scheduling, and Resourcing CUSO&#160;Reviews</h2>
        <p>Regions will solicit recommendations for CUSO reviews from the field annually. Recommendations should come from examiners, specialists, and PCOs (through their supervisors). The region will also solicit recommendations for CUSO reviews from each SSA in the region and will review CUSO Registry reports to identify CUSOs with any wide-ranging regional or national impact.</p>
        <p>During the annual resource budgeting meeting, ARPDs will review and discuss CUSOs presenting potential risk to credit unions and identify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CUSOs requiring cross-regional coordination and staffing, including identifying the region that will be primarily responsible for scheduling and staffing the review as well as any specialized resources necessary</li>
            <li>CUSOs that will receive reviews staffed and coordinated within the region, including identifying the supervisor (SE or DSA) responsible for scheduling and staffing the review</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The final selection of CUSOs for each of the review categories above will be based on potential or emerging risks resulting from the services the CUSO provides, the CUSO’s geographical footprint, and the systemic risk the CUSO’s operation may pose to credit unions regionally or nationwide.</p>
        <p>On a quarterly basis, regions will provide the following information in the quarterly workload memo to E&amp;I:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changes (additions or deletions) to the list of CUSOs scheduled for a review</li>
            <li>Anticipated dates for completion of CUSO reviews for the upcoming quarter</li>
        </ul>
