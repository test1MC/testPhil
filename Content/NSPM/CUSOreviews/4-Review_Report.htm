        <p>A CUSO review report must include six specific sections (if applicable to the CUSO):</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Cover page</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Review summary</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Review findings and recommended corrective actions (when applicable)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Loan exceptions (if applicable)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Management response</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Confidential Section (not included in draft or final report provided to CUSO officials)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The EIC&#160;will format these required sections using the <a href="../../Resources/APP-CUSOreviews/CUSO Review Report Template.docx#appendix7a">CUSO review report</a> template.</p>
        <p>The report must include the following information, which the EIC can provide in any of the six sections listed above:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">CUSO’s background information</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">List of CUSO officials/senior management (including individual backgrounds)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">CUSO’s organizational chart</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">List of credit unions that invest in, loan to, or are affected by the CUSO, and the level of involvement for each credit union listed</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><a href="3-Scope.htm">Scope of review</a>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">List of services offered by the CUSO</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">CUSO’s financial data and trends (the EIC can use the embedded CUSO FINANCIAL TEMPLATE.xlsx worksheet to incorporate information and trends into the report at his or her discretion)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The EIC has flexibility in developing the overall content of the CUSO report, and may include additional documents in the report as attachments or appendices. Additional documents should be formatted consistently with the CUSO review report template.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">An AIRES file will not be uploaded for independent CUSO reviews.</p>
