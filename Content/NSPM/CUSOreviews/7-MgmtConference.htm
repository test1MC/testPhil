            <MadCap:concept term="CUSOreviews" />Management Conference</h2>
        <p>Once DOS has distributed the final report, the EIC or supervisor may schedule a management conference with CUSO officials. While this conference is not mandatory, the EIC or supervisor will request it if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the CUSO Review Report identified material issues, or</li>
            <li>CUSO management requests a conference (management will be provided the option to hold a conference if the CUSO review does not identify material issues)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If scheduled, this conference will be held within 30 days of issuing the final report to the CUSO.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">Depending on the severity of the issues and the response of the CUSO’s management team, the EIC may need to schedule a conference with CUSO officials prior to the distribution of the report to discuss proper corrective action.  The EIC should discuss this option with, and get concurrence from, their supervisor prior to scheduling.</p>
        <p>Even if the SSA is not involved with the review, DOS should extend an invitation to the appropriate SSA to attend the management conference (if scheduled) with CUSO officials. This should only occur when the CUSO has state-chartered credit unions that invest in or loan to the CUSO, or are provided products and services by the CUSO. In these cases, DOS should provide a copy of the final review report to the SSA at least three business days before the scheduled meeting to allow the SSA sufficient time to review the final report.</p>
        <p>If a conference is held, the EIC will review report content, discuss all material concerns, and obtain formal agreement on the responses provided by CUSO management. This conference will normally be held with the CUSO board of managers and/or key management depending on the severity of the issues noted during the review. The SSA will be offered the opportunity to attend the conference meeting as applicable. The EIC should include commitments regarding conference results in the Confidential Section of the report.</p>
        <p>After the management conference (if one is held) or the final report is issued by DOS, the EIC will compile a final CUSO review package that includes all related and required review items (for example, final report, Confidential Section, etc.). The EIC will send a complete CUSO review package to DOS within five days of the management conference or, if no conference is held, within five days of issuing the final report to CUSO officials.</p>
