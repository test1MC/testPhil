            <MadCap:concept term="CUSOreviews" />General Responsibilities Regarding CUSOs</h2>
        <h3>E&amp;I</h3>
        <p>E&amp;I will monitor the national status and trends of CUSOs through data available from the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/CUSORegistry.flsnp" />. E&amp;I will use this information, along with CUSO reviews, to evaluate risk mitigation and control and to identify weaknesses in overall CUSO supervision processes. E&amp;I will maintain a SharePoint database of CUSO reviews along with the planned CUSO review list for the current year.</p>
        <p>E&amp;I will also distribute NCUA-authored CUSO reviews to SSAs that did not otherwise receive a copy of the final report from the regions.</p>
        <h3>Regional Office</h3>
        <p>Yearly, regions will solicit CUSO recommendations from NCUA staff and each SSA in the region.  During the annual resource budgeting process, ARDPs will collectively determine which CUSOs will receive on-site CUSO reviews based on SSA and field staff recommendations, a CUSO’s overall risk profile (identified through CUSO Registry information), and the availability of staff resources.</p>
        <p>DOS staff are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coordinating report actions with the examiner-in-charge, supervisor, SSAs, and CUSO officials</li>
            <li>Coordinating report responses with the CUSO, SSAs, and the EIC</li>
            <li>Finalizing and distributing draft and final reports to internal (regional, central offices, E&amp;I) and external (CUSO, SSA, credit union owners/investors) recipients</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>SE and DSA</h3>
        <p>SEs and DSAs will coordinate with examiners, specialists, and PCOs to identify CUSOs whose operations may pose potential risk and will recommend an independent CUSO review to regional management. SEs and DSAs are responsible for reviewing the yearly CUSO review recommendations provided by staff. If SEs or DSAs are presented with a case from staff that warrants more immediate attention, they will immediately notify the regional DOS director, ARDP, and ARDO.</p>
        <h3>Field Staff</h3>
        <p>Field examiners, specialists, and PCOs are responsible for identifying potential risks associated with CUSOs based on information gathered during NCUA onsite contacts, examinations, and insurance reviews.</p>
        <p>If an examiner, specialist, or PCO believes a CUSO poses significant risk to credit unions, he or she will recommend it for independent review through their supervisor. A CUSO may pose a significant risk to credit unions through its operations or the products and services it provides. It may also pose a risk to the credit unions that have an ownership in or loan to the CUSO if not financially stable.</p>
        <p>Recommending a CUSO for independent review is done annually through the referral and selection process discussed in the <a href="2-Selecting.htm">Selecting CUSOs for Review</a> section of the NSPM. If field staff determine the risks are pervasive or serious enough to warrant consideration for scheduling a review outside the annual process, they will make a recommendation to their supervisor immediately.</p>
