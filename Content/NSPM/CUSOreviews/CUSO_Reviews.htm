        <p>A credit union servicing organization, or CUSO, is an organization that is owned wholly, or in part, by one or more credit unions in order to provide services to credit unions, credit union members, or both. <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f7487481e89b2eb482b7ff41baabd9c8&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr712_main_02.tpl" target="_blank">Part 712</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> establishes requirements for CUSOs; these include limits on the amount of investments in or loans to a CUSO that an FCU can make. Certain sections of Part 712 apply to FISCUs.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ee1455905e9a00767242abc873144187&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.712_13&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">Section 712.3(d)(3)</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> requires both federal credit unions and FISCUs to have a written agreement with their CUSO that requires the CUSO to provide the NCUA and the SSA, as applicable, with complete access to any books and records and allow the NCUA to review internal controls as deemed necessary.&#160;This allows the NCUA’s review of CUSO operations.</p>
        <p>The NCUA does not have direct regulatory authority over CUSOs. However, the NCUA and SSAs (under state statutes) periodically perform independent or joint reviews of CUSOs to ensure they comply with statutory and regulatory requirements, including those in Part 712. These reviews are also designed to ensure that CUSOs use sound business practices and to determine if the CUSO is in compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements for the products and services they provide. </p>
        <p>This section of the NSPM&#160;outlines procedures for conducting independent reviews of CUSOs that may pose systemic risk to credit unions. It also explains how risks in CUSOs will be identified; the process by which independent CUSO reviews will be planned, scheduled, and staffed; and describes how CUSO review reports will be developed, distributed, and maintained.</p>
        <p>This section does not address procedures for examiners who perform a CUSO review as part of the normal credit union examination process. Examiners conducting such a review should refer to the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/ExaminersGuide.flsnp" />, the <a href="../CUSOregistry/CUSOregistry.htm">CUSO&#160;Registry review procedures outlined in the NSPM</a>, and the CUSO internal control questionnaire contained in AIRES Questions.xls.</p>
