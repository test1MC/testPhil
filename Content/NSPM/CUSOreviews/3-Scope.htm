            <MadCap:concept term="CUSOreviews" />Scope of Review</h2>
        <p>NCUA staff conducting stand-alone CUSO reviews must use the <a href="../../Resources/APP-CUSOreviews/CUSO_Review_Scope_Workbook.xlsx" target="_blank">CUSO review scope workbook</a>. The CUSO review scope workbook is not required for follow-up CUSO reviews or reviews of CUSOs conducted as part of the normal examination process.  The CUSO review scope workbook includes CUSO review steps common to all CUSOs regardless of service type. These review steps are, in large part, based on requirements outlined in <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d35e3355424d2bd8f9a9700ee82eaa77&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt12.7.712&amp;rgn=div5" target="_blank">Part 712</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" />.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"><b>Regional supervisors responsible for a CUSO review may request expertise outside of their group.</b> This may be an opportunity to bring in SMEs or other specialized resources available in the region such as regional lending specialists, RISOs, or others.</p>
        <p>The <a href="../../Resources/APP-CUSOreviews/CUSO_Review_Scope_Workbook.xlsx" target="_blank">CUSO review scope workbook</a> also provides specific review scope steps based on the products or services provided by the CUSO (for example, MBL, mortgage loan origination, IS&amp;T, investment services, etc.). While the scope workbook is intended to provide more consistency during CUSO reviews, the examiner-in-charge has the flexibility to customize the scope as needed. Not all scope steps outlined in the workbook are required; each scope should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the CUSO being reviewed.</p>
        <p>The EIC should generally design the review to determine regulatory compliance, assess the risk to investing or lending credit unions, and assess potential risks to credit unions that use the CUSO’s products or services. Examiners can also consult the CUSO section of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/ExaminersGuide.flsnp" /> for more information regarding the risks CUSOs can pose to credit unions.</p>
        <p>As part of the scheduling process, the examiner will send the CUSO a <a href="../../Resources/APP-CUSOreviews/CUSO Pre-Review Letter.docx">pre-review letter</a> that outlines goals, staff, timelines, etc. approximately 30 days before the start of a review.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">Some issues identified during a CUSO review may need to be addressed directly with individual credit unions that invest in or lend to the CUSO. For example, if a federal credit union is over the statutory limit for investments in or loans to the CUSO, or if a credit union does not have written agreement with the CUSO as required by regulation, the issue should be addressed directly with the credit union. When reviewing finalized CUSO reports, DOS will bring all such concerns to the attention of the SE and to the assigned examiner of the credit union(s) that invest in or lend to the CUSO.</p>
