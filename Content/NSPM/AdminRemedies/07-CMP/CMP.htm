            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" /><a name="_Toc410027896"></a>Civil Money Penalty</h2>
        <p>The NCUA’s authority to impose civil money penalties against federally insured credit unions that do not meet a quarterly Call Report filing deadline is granted under Section 202 of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/FCUAct.flsnp" /> (12 U.S.C. §1782).  The NCUA coordinates with SSAs to assess CMPs against FISCUs, and, as a matter of courtesy and fairness, takes any late-filing fees assessed by the state into account when assessing a CMP.</p>
        <p>The NCUA announced that all credit unions must file Call Reports electronically in Letter to Credit Unions 13-CU-11, <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/Documents/LCU2013-11.pdf#search=Electronic Filing of Call Reports and Extended Filing Dates for 2014" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink">Electronic Filing of Call Reports and Extended Filing Dates for 2014</a>.</p>
