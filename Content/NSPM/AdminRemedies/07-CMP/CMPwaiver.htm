        <p>The E&amp;I&#160;Director has the delegated authority to reduce or waive a CMP issued due to late filing of a 5300 Call Report. The NCUA may elect not to assess a penalty if a credit union files late due to extenuating circumstances such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“Acts of God” such as:<ul><li>A natural disaster or weather event that impairs a credit union’s operation</li><li>A power failure, internet failure, or failure of a credit union’s core-processing system immediately prior to or at the filing deadline</li><li>The death or physical/emotional incapacitation of a key employee (only acceptable if a credit union is too small to have back-up personnel)</li><li>Turnover of a key position just prior to the deadline (only acceptable if a credit union is too small to have back-up personnel)</li></ul></li>
            <li>Robbery of a credit union that impairs the credit union’s ability to file on time</li>
            <li>A <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/DataApps/CUOnline/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">CU Online</a> filing problem unique to a credit union, not including an error or warning that a filer does not know how to clear or answer (must be supported by a help desk ticket time/date stamped near, but prior to, the filing deadline)</li>
            <li>Credit union, SSA, or the NCUA accidentally unsubmit a Call Report after successfully submitting it prior to the deadline</li>
            <li>Merger with another credit union</li>
            <li>Liquidation or conservatorship</li>
        </ul>
