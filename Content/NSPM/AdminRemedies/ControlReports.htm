        <p><a name="_Control_Reports"></a>Control reports serve as a mechanism to ensure the NCUA&#160;has a robust examination program that is properly resourced and monitored for adherence to national examination and quality standards.</p>
        <h3><a name="_Toc410027907"></a>E&amp;I Control Reports</h3>
        <p>E&amp;I will routinely request reports from the regions and may periodically request a sampling of issued administrative actions for quality control purposes as part of an ongoing quality assurance process.</p>
        <p>E&amp;I will review regional activity as a means of tracking regional and national trends for resource, consistency, and policy formation purposes and will issue a semi-annual national summary of administrative actions.</p>
        <h3><a name="_Toc410027906"></a>Regional Control Reports</h3>
        <p>The region is responsible for maintaining record of all <a href="TypesAdminRemedies.htm">informal and formal administrative actions</a> including, but not limited to, issued <a href="RDL.htm">RDLs</a>, <a href="05-LUA/LUA.htm">LUAs</a> and <a href="06-PWL/PWL.htm">PWLs</a>. The report will include administrative actions newly issued, currently outstanding (with the exception of Regional Director letters), and those canceled (when applicable) since the last report. The region will periodically evaluate the trends, appropriateness and effectiveness of administrative actions.<MadCap:footnote class="footnote"><p> Until a national database/tool is developed, regions will continue to use reporting systems currently in place. Regions will ensure their current systems capture the requested information.</p></MadCap:footnote></p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"> Regions are only responsible for reporting Regional Director letters associated with an examination or supervision contact report and part of the administrative record.</p>
