            <h3><a name="_Toc410027887"></a>FISCU LUAs</h3>
            <p>In the case of a FISCU insurance review, examiners will invite the SSA to help draft the LUA, participate in meeting with key officials, and attend the joint conference. Examiners will also allow the SSA five business days to review and approve the final draft before submitting the LUA to the officials.</p>
            <p>LUAs initiated and issued by the SSA often include a Regional Director signature line. If an SSA is issuing an LUA and requesting a Regional Director signature, field staff will still be involved in the development of the LUA and a DOS quality control review will still occur. The NCUA EIC will work with the SSA EIC to develop the content, and the supervisor and DOS will review as expediently as possible. The SSA director signs the document first and then sends the three copies to the Regional Director for signature and two are returned to the SSA for issuance and their file.</p>
