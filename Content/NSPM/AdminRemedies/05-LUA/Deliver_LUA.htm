            <li>Collect all signed LUAs (minimum of two)&#160;after the meeting<ul><li>If the officials refuse to sign an LUA, examiners will prepare a report documenting the refusal and recommend a course of action, such as a <a href="../06-PWL/PWL.htm">Preliminary Warning Letter</a>. </li></ul></li>
            <li>Submit signed LUAs (minimum of two), through their supervisor, to the regional DOS within three days of the LUA&#160;meeting for the Regional Director's signature</li>

            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" /><a name="_Toc410027893"></a>Deliver a Final, Signed LUA</h4>
        <p>After the Regional Director signs an LUA, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Mail one of the original, signed LUAs to the credit union with the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/LUA/LUA Cover Letter.docx#Appendix11F">Regional Director cover letter</a></li>

            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Scan and email electronic copies of the signed LUA to the examiner and their supervisor<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">For a jointly issued LUA, DOS will mail a copy of the signed LUA to the SSA (or an original signed LUA if the regional office preferred the examiner to obtain a third signed copy).</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the situation where an LUA is issued and the credit union was downgraded to a CAMEL 4 or 5, a <a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/LUA/Acknowledge LUA and CAMEL Downgrade.docx"><a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/LUA/Acknowledge LUA and CAMEL Downgrade.docx#Appendix11D">Regional Director letter acknowledging the LUA and downgrade</a></a> may be appropriate.
