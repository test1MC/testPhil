            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" /><a name="_Toc410027885"></a>Letter of Understanding and Agreement</h2>
        <p>A letter of understanding and agreement lists a credit union’s specific material problems and the corrective actions necessary to resolve them. It demonstrates to the officials the problems are a major concern to the NCUA and formally requests that officials agree to the listed actions in lieu of the agency taking formal administrative action (assuming it is an <a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/LUA/Non-published LUA.docx">unpublished LUA</a>; a published LUA is a <a href="../TypesAdminRemedies.htm">formal administrative action</a>). The LUA will identify the areas of concern and the necessary corrective actions. Examiners will ensure LUA directives and timeframes are clear, specific, measurable, and easily understandable. No LUA will have a specific termination date unless the LUA is drafted in conjunction with a newly chartered credit union and not as a result of significant problems.</p>
        <p>An examiner’s recommendation to issue an LUA typically needs to be based on an examination, follow-up examination, or onsite supervision contact supported by an AIRES upload. Examiners will meet with key staff, officials of the credit union, and the SSA (in the case of joint contacts) during the examination or follow-up examination to develop an LUA.</p>
        <div class="redacted" MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted">
            <p>The examination or supervision report must support all problems or conditions listed in the LUA. Supervisory Letter 10-04, <a href="http://ncuacentral/EANDI/Shared Documents/EI Letters to CU's, Supervisory Letters, and Risk Alerts/Supervisory Letter 10-04 - Administrative Remedies.pdf" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink">Administrative Remedies</a>, is a resource for examiners to refer to when preparing LUAs and other administrative actions. A <a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/LUA/Non-published LUA.docx"><a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/LUA/Non-published LUA.docx#Appendix11E">template for unpublished LUAs</a></a> is provided as a resource to this section of the NSPM. For a published LUA template, refer to <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/EnforcementManual.flsnp" />. OGC is available to assist in preparing, reviewing, and negotiating any LUA should such assistance be desired and requested by the regional office.</p>
