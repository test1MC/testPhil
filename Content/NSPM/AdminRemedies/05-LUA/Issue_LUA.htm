            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" /><a name="_Toc410027891"></a>Issue an LUA</h3>
        <p>Examiners will ensure all significant concerns and corrective actions outlined in an LUA are documented in the DOR module. The LUA will address the most significant concerns identified in the DOR; it will not necessarily be an exact duplicate. However, an item in an LUA <a href="Problem_Code_Illustration.htm">must be recorded in the DOR module and flow through the DOR</a> either at a prior contact or at the same contact during which the LUA is issued.</p>
        <p>LUAs may either be issued/signed at the joint conference, or at a subsequent meeting specifically for the LUA signing after the joint conference and close of the examination. If an examiner opts to leave an exam open to issue the LUA at the joint conference, they may request a waiver of the 60-day completion requirement, up to a total of 90 days.</p>
        <p>To prepare an LUA, examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Obtain supervisor concurrence and document supervisor agreement in the Confidential Section, as required <a href="../../DistrictMgmt/08-AdministrativeItems/AIRES-MinimalUpload.htm">by the NSPM</a></li>
            <li>Discuss the intent and the preliminary content of the LUA during the preliminary meeting with management in advance of signing the LUA</li>
            <li>Notify management, with their supervisor, that the issuance of an LUA is subject to review by the Regional Director</li>
            <li>Draft an LUA and email it to their supervisor no later than three business days after completing the contact</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Upon receiving a draft LUA, supervisors will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Review the LUA and make a recommendation to either issue it or not</li>
            <li>Notify the appropriate associate regional director of all LUAs to be issued, regardless of asset size of a credit union</li>
            <li>Forward the draft LUA to the region’s DOS mailbox for processing and Regional Director approval within seven business days from receiving the draft LUA from the examiner</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Upon receiving an LUA&#160;from a supervisor, DOS&#160;will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discuss all material changes to the LUA with the field supervisor</li>
            <li>Return the final, approved version of the LUA to the supervisor by e-mail, or by other means as appropriate, for delivery to the credit union</li>
            <li>Work with the supervisor and examiner to review the draft LUA in a mutually agreeable timeframe</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examiners will send an electronic copy of the final, approved LUA to credit union officials via ZixMail, before the signing meeting. Examiners will allow officials a minimum of two business days to review the LUA before they sign it. Examiners will print at least two copies of the final approved LUA and present it to the officials in the <a href="Deliver_LUA.htm">manner described in the NSPM</a>. If a quorum of directors signs the LUA, it is considered to be accepted by the board.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"> DOS and the credit union receive the original signed copies of the LUA. The supervisor and the examiner will receive a scanned electronic copy (from DOS) for their records. In the case of a FISCU, the regional office will decide if a third original copy is necessary.</p>
