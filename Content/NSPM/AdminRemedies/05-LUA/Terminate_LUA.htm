        <p>When a credit union meets the specific performance standards outlined in an LUA, examiners will recommend to the Regional Director to terminate the LUA. Examiners will not report orally or in writing to the credit union that the LUA is terminated prior to Regional Director approval. Examiners may recommend the termination of an LUA only after an examination or onsite contact supported by adequate work papers showing the credit union has corrected the problems cited in the LUA.</p>
        <p>When conditions warrant the termination of an LUA, the examiner will prepare a draft <a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/LUA/Remove LUA.docx#appendix11h">LUA removal letter</a> to the credit union explaining why the Regional Director is removing the LUA and forward the letter to the supervisor with an explanation in the email supporting their recommendation to terminate the LUA. After review, the supervisor will forward the draft letter to DOS Mail. DOS will review and process the letter to the credit union for Regional Director signature. The NCUA will consult with the SSA for termination of joint LUAs.</p>
