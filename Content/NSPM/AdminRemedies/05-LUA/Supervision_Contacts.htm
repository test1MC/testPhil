            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" /><a name="_Toc410027894"></a>Supervision Contacts for a Credit Union with an LUA</h3>
        <p>Frequency of examinations, follow-up examinations, and onsite supervision contacts is driven by a credit union’s CAMEL ratings and overall risk to the share insurance fund. Examiners will consider any outstanding administrative actions when planning supervision and assigning the CAMEL ratings. If examiners encounter a credit union with an outstanding administrative action (and associated risk), and the risk is not reflected in the CAMEL ratings (which drive the frequency of supervision), they will discuss with their supervisor and plan supervision accordingly.</p>
        <p>Unless there are extenuating circumstances, and approved by the associate regional director, supervision of credit unions with outstanding administrative actions will be in line with national policy for CAMEL 3, 4, or 5 credit unions.</p>
        <p>During the time in which an LUA is in place, examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare and distribute the examination or supervision contacts reports in the same manner as other examinations and supervision contacts</li>
            <li>Document compliance with the LUA in the Status Update during each contact. The status of each item will be listed as completed, not completed, or partially completed. Include comments to support completion status</li>
            <li>Document recommendations for future action such as continue, modify, terminate the LUA, or proceed with elevated or formal administrative action</li>
            <li>Recommend removal of the LUA during a follow-up examination or regular examination, if the officials have corrected the problem areas (The examiner will prepare a draft letter for the Regional Director’s signature explaining why they recommend removal of the LUA.)</li>
            <li>Recommend elevated administrative action if the officials have not corrected the problem areas within the timeframes outlined in the LUA<ul><li>This could be formal action such as a published LUA, Cease and Desist order, civil money penalty, involuntary liquidation, etc. Refer to <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/EnforcementManual.flsnp" />, for processing procedures of formal administrative actions.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Document the existence of an LUA in AIRES in the Exam Management Console (Administrative Tracking section of the Completion Information tab)</li>
        </ul>
