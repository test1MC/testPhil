            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" />Outstanding DOR Items</h3>
        <p>Recurring or unresolved problems are continually identified as leading to credit union failures and losses to the share insurance fund. Examiners must ensure that items significant enough to be included in a DOR are resolved in a timely manner. For any credit union with a recurring or unresolved DOR item, regardless of its CAMEL rating, field staff will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure all prior examination DOR items are properly noted as resolved, unresolved, or no longer applicable, and appropriately documented within the DOR module</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure repeat problem areas are properly noted, with accurate comments and accurate dates of identification<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">When the original identification date is used for a repeat DOR item, examiners will ensure the corrective action is the same as the previous DOR (not necessarily the wording – but the type of corrective action).</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document credit union officials’ failure to adequately resolve problems by placing an asterisk beside the repeat DOR item and include a footnote, "This is either a repeat or carry-over DOR. Please see the DOR&#160;Status Update document for specific information on individual DOR&#160;items."</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Consider the quality of management, and weigh management’s failure to resolve problems in the management CAMEL component and overall composite rating</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a credit union fails to take corrective action within the timeframe stated in the DOR, it must submit a written response to the examiner. This applies to all credit unions, regardless of CAMEL rating. If a credit union fails to take the corrective action agreed to at the last examination/supervision contact, examiners will document why management failed to take corrective action in the DOR module of AIRES (in the DOR Status and Comment section). If additional documentation is necessary beyond what is provided to the credit union in the DOR Status Report or other open sections of the report, examiners may use the Confidential Section.</p>
        <p>If a credit union fails to address outstanding DOR items, the examiner will recommend additional enforcement action, such as a <a href="../RDL.htm">Regional Director letter</a>, <a href="../05-LUA/LUA.htm">Letter of Understanding and Agreement</a>, or <a href="../06-PWL/PWL.htm">Preliminary Warning Letter</a>. If the supervisor does not concur with additional enforcement action, examiners will document the rationale in the Confidential Section. Examiners will include the nature of the problem, agreements to correct the problem, their supervision plans, and the reason no additional enforcement action was pursued.</p>
