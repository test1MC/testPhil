            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" />No Longer Applicable DOR&#160;Items</h3>
        <p>There may be instances when an examiner will need to mark a DOR item as no longer applicable in the DOR&#160;module, rather than Resolved or Unresolved. Examiners will not use NLA if a credit union has resolved the problem. Examiners must provide a comment when marking an item as NLA.</p>
        <p>For example, it may be appropriate to use NLA if a DOR required the credit union to perform due diligence on a new indirect lending program, and the examiner finds that the credit union has discontinued its indirect lending program.</p>
