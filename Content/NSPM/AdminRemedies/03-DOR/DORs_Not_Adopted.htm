            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" />DORs Not Adopted</h3>
        <p>Examiners will work with credit union management to develop corrective action plans. However, if officials do not adopt a DOR or a specific corrective action plan at the exit meeting or joint conference, examiners will document the officials’ disagreement or inaction using the following footnote:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“These plans for action, although not approved by the credit union officials, are recommended to correct the area of concern. The officials have agreed to review the plans and to notify the Regional Director, National Credit Union Administration, [enter appropriate address], by [enter date], of the actions to be taken.”</p>
        </blockquote>
