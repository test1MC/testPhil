            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" />Problem Resolution</h3>
        <p>If a problem has been ongoing for many years, examiners must use judgment to determine whether it meets the definition for a DOR. Examiners should take the appropriate action, which may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marking a DOR as NLA because it has not caused harm to the financial or operational condition of the credit union</li>
            <li>Issuing a new corrective action plan that better addresses the root cause of the problem</li>
            <li>Moving the problem to the Examiner’s Findings, or</li>
            <li>Recommending escalated enforcement action</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If an examiner determines that a problem is particularly severe, they will notify their supervisor and consider drafting a <a href="../RDL.htm">Regional Director letter</a> urging the credit union officials to accept the resolution offered in the DOR or to formulate an acceptable alternate plan that recognizes and resolves the problem(s). However, it may be necessary to recommend escalated administrative action if agreement cannot be reached and the overall risk to the credit union warrants such action.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">Examiners should notify the Supervisory Examiner of <a href="../../DishonestyFraud/00-DishonestFraud.htm">suspected fraud or ethical concerns</a> in order to develop an appropriate supervisory strategy.</p>
        <h4 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CC:{Sr=1}. ';">Document Disagreements</h4>
        <p>Examiners should document all cases of disagreement and the intended steps to ensure proper resolution and follow-up of the problems identified in the Confidential Section of the examination report.</p>
        <h4>
Request a Response to a DOR</h4>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, examiners are required to obtain written responses to a DOR from credit union officials. To fulfill this obligation, examiners may include an action item in the DOR requiring the credit union to provide a written response to the examination report by a specific date. Examiners may also address this request in any open section of the examination report as necessary. When including this action item in the DOR, examiners will utilize the Non-Risk (Housekeeping) option under the risk areas in the DOR module.</p>
        <h4>
Follow-up on DOR&#160;Items</h4>
        <p>Generally, examiners should follow-up on DOR items within 120 days after the timeframe for completion has passed. In the case of CAMEL 3, 4, and 5 credit unions, the current follow-up supervision requirements outlined in the <a href="../../DistrictMgmt/00-DistrictManagement.htm">District Management</a> section of the NSPM will allow for adequate follow-up on DORs.</p>
        <p>In CAMEL 1 and 2 credit unions with a DOR, examiners should evaluate whether a CAMEL 1 or 2 rating is warranted. If it is, examiners can set the timeframe for completion to coincide with the next scheduled contact or examination. If the DOR is so time-sensitive that it needs to be completed sooner than before the next scheduled contact or examination, examiners will follow-up within 120 days of the timeframe for completion.</p>
        <p>Examiners need to follow-up on outstanding DOR items through both on and off-site supervision. Examiners must follow national policy outlined in this manual (see the <a href="../../FCUprogram/00-FCU_Program.htm">FCU Program and Procedures</a> and <a href="../../FISCUprogram/00-FISCU_Program.htm">FISCU Program and Procedures</a> sections of the NSPM) for completing on and off-site supervision.</p>
        <p>Examiners should track DOR timeframes for completion and follow-up with credit union management via phone call or e-mail to discuss the status of DOR items as part of off-site supervision. Examiners should mark a DOR&#160;that can be confirmed off-site as resolved or unresolved in the DOR module accordingly and upload the AIRES file.</p>
        <p>For other items that need to be reviewed on-site, examiners should determine their status and update the DOR module at the next scheduled on-site contact. For simplicity, examiners may consider using the next scheduled contact date to determine the time-frame for completion.</p>
        <p>When on-site for a follow-up contact or at the following examination, examiners should include review of the prior DOR in the examination scope. If unresolved DOR items are identified, examiners should first identify why the item is unresolved to properly address and resolve the recurring problem. The reason a DOR item remains unresolved will determine the subsequent steps necessary.</p>
        <p>The first step is to identify why credit union management did not resolve the problem. Consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Did management make a good faith effort and comply with a majority of the corrective action plan?</li>
            <li>Did the corrective action plan prove to be unachievable or unreasonable?</li>
            <li>Did management resolve the root problem in a different manner than was agreed upon in the DOR?</li>
            <li>Did management comply with the corrective action plan, but the action did not resolve the problem?</li>
            <li>Did management ignore the corrective action plan?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There may be additional reasons the credit union did not comply with a corrective action plan. Examiners should consider these reasons when determining the best way to address unresolved problems. For example, if management willfully neglects to address the problem the examiner should consider how management’s inaction affects the credit union’s CAMEL and risk ratings and whether escalated administrative action is necessary.</p>
        <p>In instances where management completed a majority of the corrective action plan, the original DOR item was unachievable, or management complied with the corrective action plan but it did not solve the problem, examiners should develop a new corrective action plan to resolve the problem. Examiners should use their judgment to determine whether it is a repeat DOR item or if the original DOR item is NLA.</p>
        <p>In instances where management made a good faith effort or has completed a majority of the elements of a corrective action plan, a repeat DOR may not be warranted if the remaining items can be corrected in the normal course of business. Examiners should use the DOR definition outlined above to determine whether a problem should remain a DOR. Examiners must mark DOR items resolved when a credit union has implemented the corrective action, even if the financial trends do not yet reflect the improvements the actions were intended to correct.</p>
        <p>For example, a credit union has a high operating expense to average asset ratio and negative earnings. The DOR corrective action plan requires the credit union to reduce operating expenses. When the examiner follows-up, they note the credit union has made adequate expense cuts; however, the operating expense to average asset ratio remains high and will not reflect the full impact of the expense cuts for two more quarters. In this case, the examiner should mark the DOR as resolved. The examiner has multiple options to address the ongoing risk including, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Documenting the credit union’s compliance with the DOR in the DOR Status Report and note management should continue to monitor the operating expense to average asset ratio until the financial ratios reach the agreed upon goal.</li>
            <li>Documenting the credit union’s compliance with the DOR in the Examination Overview and noting management should continue to monitor the operating expense to average asset ratio until the financial ratios reach the agreed upon goal. Create a new DOR for the credit union to achieve the agreed upon ratio goal (e.g., “achieve an operating expense to aver-age asset ratio of X.XX%”) with timeframe for resolution in two quarters to provide the financial ratios time to reflect the operating expense cuts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For DOR corrective action items that will take more than one year to reflect full compliance, examiners should consider issuing individual DORs to achieve quarterly goals, with the applicable timeframe for completion. Examiners should work with credit union management to develop reasonable goals to include in the DOR.</p>
