            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" />Document of Resolution</h2>
        <p>The AIRES DOR module enhances the administrative record as it improves the tracking and reporting of unresolved DOR items. Reports generated from this data summarize and track problem areas to highlight the resolution of outstanding problems. The <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/AIRESmanual.flsnp" /> addresses the proper use of the DOR module. Examiners will make full use of the DOR module.</p>
        <p>Through its lease agreements, the NCUA requires  SSAs that use NCUA-issued laptops to use AIRES and, specifically, the DOR module. During the course of <a href="../../WCC/WCC-General.htm">WCC 26</a> reviews, NCUA examiners will add any problem codes (and associated corrective action) needed beyond those entered by the SSA as required in the NSPM&#160;to <a href="../../FISCUprogram/05-Review_State_Exam.htm">complete a review of a state examination</a>.</p>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" />Field Staff Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>To ensure a full administrative record of problem areas, examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Create DOR items and assign problem codes using the DOR module in AIRES</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure DOR items are consistent between the DOR module and the DOR</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Require credit union management to submit a written action plan, within 30 days of receipt of the official examination report, if they do not agree to the DOR or adopt the DOR at the joint conference<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">If communication and negotiation efforts are unsuccessful and the DOR is not adopted, examiners will require management to provide an alternative resolution plan and note management’s failure to adopt the DOR in the Confidential Section. Elevated administrative action will be used if management’s action plan is insufficient to address the problem(s) and the problem(s) remain unresolved.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ShadedBox">If the SSA did not enter problem codes in the DOR module but provided a DOR to the credit union, NCUA examiners are required to do so for items that meet the NCUA’s definition of a DOR.<br /></p>
        <h3>Quality Control</h3>
        <p>E&amp;I periodically reviews reports and samples examinations to ensure compliance. E&amp;I will notify the regions of any long-standing problems and DOR items. Regions are responsible for following up with field staff.</p>
