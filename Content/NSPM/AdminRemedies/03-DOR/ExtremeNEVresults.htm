            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" />Extreme NEV Supervisory Test Results</h1>
        <p>The appropriate corrective action for extreme NEV Supervisory Test results depends on the source of the IRR exposure. (See NCUA&#160;Letter to Credit Unions 16-CU-08, <a href="https://www.ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/Pages/policy-compliance/communications/letters-to-credit-unions/2016/08.aspx" target="_blank">Revised Interest Rate Risk Supervision</a>.) Elevated levels of IRR raise the degree of potential urgency that a credit union may need to act. Consequently, examiners should request, through their field supervisor, assistance from specialized resources such as the Regional Capital Market Specialists for credit unions with extreme NEV Supervisory Test results.</p>
        <p>When using credit union-generated NEV information (verified by the examiner) for FCUs greater than $100 million in assets<MadCap:footnote style="mc-footnote-position: topic;">The IRR examination scope prescribes the number of exam steps using total assets.  Credit unions with total assets of $100 million or less do not require the IRR Workbook, including the NEV Supervisory Test.</MadCap:footnote>  and the NEV&#160;Supervisory Test results are extreme, examiners must issue a <a href="http://publishedguides.ncua.lan/examiner/Pages/Default.htm" target="_blank">DOR</a> or other supervisory action to reduce the IRR exposure unless extenuating circumstances exist.  The DOR will require credit union management to develop a plan to reduce the credit union’s IRR exposure to a less than an extreme risk level as measured by the NEV Supervisory Test and submit the plan to the Regional Director within 45 days of the DOR issuance, as seen below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exam process (60 days)<ul><li>When NEV&#160;supervisory results are extreme, issue DOR&#160;for management to develop a plan to de-risk within 45 days</li></ul></li>
            <li>Credit union develops de-risk plan (within 45 days)<ul><li>Credit union management submits plan to de-risk within 45 days of DOR&#160;delivery.</li></ul></li>
            <li>NCUA&#160;reviews de-risk plan (within 30 days of receipt)<ul><li>If revisions are necessary, credit union resubmits updated plan within 30 days and NCUA&#160;responds to revisions within 30 days.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Credit union de-risks in accordance with de-risk plan<ul><li>On- or off-site supervision to evaluate DOR progress until management fully achieves DOR&#160;and reduces IRR&#160;exposure to plan levels.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examiners will inform management during the DOR development process that an extreme IRR level represents undue risk (<a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Exam Governance/Rules and Regulations/Part 741 – Requirements for Insurance.pdf" target="_blank">§741.3(d)</a>).   The NCUA will provide credit unions the opportunity to reduce the IRR level.  However, in the rare circumstances a credit union is unable or unwilling to de-risk, regions must follow a process that involves providing a recommendation to the NCUA Board to reclassify the credit union's net worth classification down a category based upon safety and soundness (<a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Exam Governance/Rules and Regulations/Part 702 - Capital Adequacy.pdf" target="_blank">§702.102(b)</a>). In this rare situation, examiners will follow the <a href="#Unresolv">process for unresolved extreme IRR</a>.</p>
        <h2>Extenuating Circumstances</h2>
        <p>Extenuating circumstances may exist that suggest a DOR may not be necessary when the IRR level is extreme.  Typically, a low book equity position or material positions in long duration asset portfolios that have significant price sensitivity cause extreme NEV Supervisory Test results.   In a situation that involves a credit union building its low net worth through an existing <a href="http://publishedguides.ncua.lan/nspm/Pages/Default.htm#NSPM/PCA/04-NWRPs-RBPs/NWRP_and_RBP.htm" target="_blank">NWRP</a> and not holding long duration assets, the post shock NEV ratio would likely be extreme and the post shock NEV sensitivity likely low or moderate.  A DOR would not be effective in this situation because the credit union is addressing its low net worth issue through the NWRP and the balance sheet’s IRR exposure is limited at low or moderate sensitivity.  For further information on IRR related DORs, see Tab F – Overall IRR Rating – Section III: Supervisory Actions in the <a href="https://publishedguides.ncua.gov/examiner/Pages/Content/PDFs/IRR Workbook Guide EXTERNAL.pdf" target="_blank">Guidance to IRR Workbook</a>.</p>
        <p>The timeframe to reduce IRR exposure depends upon the facts and circumstances of the credit union and the de-risking strategy, typically either active or passive strategies.  (For more information, see   <a href="http://publishedguides.ncua.lan/examiner/Pages/Default.htm" target="_blank">Mitigation Strategies</a> in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/ExaminersGuide.flsnp" />.)</p>
        <h1><a name="Unresolv"></a>Unresolved Extreme IRR</h1>
        <p>Extreme IRR is classified as unresolved if 45 days have elapsed since the DOR was issued and the credit union has not provided a plan to reduce the extreme IRR, or if credit union management refuses to accept the de-risking DOR (and a final report has been issued documenting the refusal).</p>
        <p>NCUA regions are required to respond to a credit union’s unwillingness or inability to de-risk. First, the NCUA region will inform the credit union of either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inadequate progress towards developing a de-risking plan, or</li>
            <li>Inability or unwillingness to de-risk</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The region will also recommend to the NCUA Board, through E&amp;I, the reclassification of the credit union’s net worth classification, based on safety and soundness concerns associated with the extreme IRR level (<a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Exam Governance/Rules and Regulations/Part 702 - Capital Adequacy.pdf" target="_blank">§702.102</a>).</p>
        <p>Next, there is a timing-based open notice and opportunity for hearing, as described in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=5fbb89d2ee978b0052ee2cce88a930c6&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.747_12003&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§747.2003</a> of NCUA rules and regulations. If the NCUA Board determines, after the notice and opportunity for hearing, that the credit union is an unsafe or unsound condition or has not corrected a materially unsafe or unsound practice, it may reclassify the net worth classification of a "well capitalized"&#160;credit union down to "adequately capitalized,"&#160;and require an "adequately capitalized"&#160;or "undercapitalized" credit union to comply with certain mandatory or discretionary supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower net worth category, based upon safety and soundness (<a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Exam Governance/Rules and Regulations/Part 702 - Capital Adequacy.pdf" target="_blank">§702.102(b)</a>).</p>
        <p>A credit union may request the NCUA Board rescind a reclassification. This is likely to occur when the credit union is no longer in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has corrected a materially unsafe or unsound practice.</p>
