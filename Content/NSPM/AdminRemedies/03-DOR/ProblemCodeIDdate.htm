            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" />Problem Code Identification Date</h3>
        <p>Examiners will enter all problems that meet the criteria for a DOR item into the AIRES DOR module for problem code tracking purposes. The AIRES DOR module and corresponding problem codes are to track repeat problems and DOR corrective action items, not necessarily continued areas of concern.</p>
        <p>Examiners will complete the problem code area in the AIRES DOR module, including the date the problem was first identified. The problem code and associated date will be specific to the problem, and not just the problem area or risk factor. When completing the problem code areas in the AIRES DOR module, examiners will list the effective date the specific problem was originally identified.</p>
        <p>When a problem was identified in the past, but was resolved and remained resolved for a period of time (at least one to two contacts) examiners should not use the original date identified, but code it as a new problem. Examiners should ensure they are recording the corrective actions taken to resolve specific problems and not combine similar problems as an ongoing problem.</p>
        <p>For example, a small credit union may have had internal control problems for ten years. The NCUA needs to track whether the credit union is complying with the specific DOR corrective action plans issued at each exam. At the June 30 examination, the examiner issued a DOR corrective action plan to cross train employees and increase segregation of duties. When the examiner performs a follow-up examination effective 12/31, the examiner finds the credit union is in compliance with this corrective action plan and the examiner should show this DOR item as resolved. During the December 31 follow-up examination, the examiner issues a DOR corrective action plan for the supervisory committee to expand their review area. The date identified for this DOR item is December 31, since it is a new problem with a new corrective action plan. However, this does not mean that internal controls are not an ongoing problem in this case. Examiners should acknowledge this and expand the scope as necessary, draft the DOR to address the root cause of the problem, or reflect the ongoing risk in the risk and CAMEL ratings.</p>
        <p>Credit unions that have a history of similar or the same problems, even if there are long gaps between them, may warrant expanded review of that area or a DOR to address the root cause of the problem. Recurring problems are an indication that the root problem needs to be addressed. For example, if an examiner writes a DOR to fund the ALLL account and determines that the officials properly funded the account at a follow-up contact, the examiner should mark the DOR as resolved. If the examiner notes at the next examination or contact that the ALLL is again underfunded, the examiner should develop a new DOR, with a new identification date, that addresses the root cause of the underfunded ALLL (for example, inadequate methodology, no internal controls to ensure the expense is recorded, etc.).</p>
        <p>When a credit union has partially complied with a DOR item, the examiner must determine if the remaining corrective actions should still be included in the DOR. If an examiner determines it does not need to remain in the DOR, the examiner will mark the DOR as resolved; otherwise, the examiner will mark the DOR item as unresolved and carry forward with the same date identified. If the examiner wishes to re-write the DOR corrective action plan, they should mark it as resolved, noting in the comment section of the DOR module that only part of the DOR corrective action plan has been resolved, and then create a new DOR corrective action plan to address the remaining problems with the original date identified.</p>
