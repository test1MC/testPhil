            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" /><a name="_Toc410027882"></a>Regional Director Letter</h2>
        <p>A Regional Director letter is used when a credit union has serious and/or persistent problem areas that are not being resolved through field supervision alone. Examiners will ensure they fully address the issues through the examination process first, but a letter from the Regional Director is an option to further emphasize the areas of concern. </p>
