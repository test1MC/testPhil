        <p>Administrative remedies are a broad range of actions that, while including formal actions such as published <a href="05-LUA/LUA.htm">LUAs</a> and cease and desist orders, also includes informal actions such as <a href="03-DOR/DOR.htm">DORs</a>, <a href="RDL.htm">RDLs</a>, unpublished LUAs, and <a href="06-PWL/PWL.htm">PWLs</a>. These actions are available to prevent or eliminate serious operational and financial problems in credit unions. Administrative remedies provide protection to credit unions, credit union members, creditors, the share insurance fund, and the credit union industry. Administrative remedies are tools available to the NCUA to affect problem resolution.</p>
        <p>The NSPM provides an overview of administrative actions and establishes expectations, procedures, and controls for developing and processing specific informal and formal actions. This guidance, and the provided correspondence templates, are intended to improve efficiency and consistency in preparing administrative actions. The templates must be modified to make them suitable for the particular facts and circumstances of a given case. The details of the particular problems, as well as the expected timeframes and specific corrective action, should be clearly spelled out in the body of the agreement. The Office of General Counsel is available to assist in preparing, reviewing, and negotiating any formal administrative action should such assistance be desired and requested by the regional office.</p>
