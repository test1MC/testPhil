        <p>With the exception of a DOR, the Regional Director must approve all informal actions.</p>

            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies">
            </MadCap:concept>Formal Actions</h3>
        <p>Formal actions, also known as enforcement actions, are taken when an event triggers a level of concern requiring immediate attention and/or informal actions have not resolved the core concerns to the NCUA’s satisfaction. Unlike most informal actions, formal actions are authorized by statute (and, in some cases, mandated), are generally more severe, and may be disclosed to the public. The Office of General Counsel must be consulted on all formal actions and they must be approved as outlined in the Delegations of Authority. When considering a formal action, consult OGC as early in the process as possible.</p>
        <p>Before deciding to take formal administrative action, an examiner and their supervisor must clearly understand the nature of acredit union's problems and why any previous attempts to resolve the problems failed. Examiners are responsible for ensuring an administrative record presents a complete, factual, and fully documented history of the credit union's problems and the examiner’s concerns about the credit union. Examiners will recommend formal administrative action after consulting with their supervisor. Prior to proceeding, the supervisor will discuss the action with the associate regional director, who will receive concurrence from the Regional Director. It is critical that the field and region initiate communication early when formal administrative action is recommended.</p>
