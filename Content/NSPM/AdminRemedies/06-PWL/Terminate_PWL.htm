        <p>When a credit union meets the specific performance standards outlined in a PWL, examiners will recommend termination of the PWL. Examiners will recommend the termination of a PWL only after they complete an examination or onsite contact supported by adequate work papers showing the credit union has corrected the problems cited in the PWL.</p>
        <p>When conditions warrant the termination of a PWL, the examiner will prepare a draft <a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/PWL/PWL Removal Samples.docx">PWL removal letter</a> to the credit union explaining why the Regional Director is removing the PWL. The examiner will forward the draft letter to the supervisor with an explanation in the email supporting their recommendation to terminate the PWL. After review, the supervisor will forward the draft letter to DOS Mail for review and processing for Regional Director signature.</p>
