            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" /><a name="_Toc410027901"></a>Supervision Contacts for a Credit Union with a PWL</h3>
        <p>As described in the <a href="../05-LUA/Supervision_Contacts.htm">LUA section of the NSPM</a>, the frequency of examinations, follow-up examinations, and onsite supervision contacts is driven by a credit union’s CAMEL ratings and overall risk to the share insurance fund. Examiners will consider any outstanding administrative action when planning supervision assigning the CAMEL ratings. If an examiner encounters a credit union with an outstanding administrative action (and associated risk) and the risk is not reflected in the CAMEL rating (which drives the frequency of supervision), they will discuss with their supervisor and plan their supervision accordingly.</p>
        <p>Unless there are extenuating circumstances, and approved by the associate regional director, supervision of credit unions with outstanding administrative actions will be in line with national policy for CAMEL 3, 4, and 5 credit unions (perform a follow-up examination at least every 120 or 180 days (from completion date to completion date)).</p>
        <p>Examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prepare and distribute the examination or supervision contact reports in the same manner as other examinations and supervision contacts</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document compliance with the PWL in the Status Update during each contact<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;"> The status of each item will be listed as completed, not completed, or partially completed. Examiners will include comments to support completion status.</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document recommendations for future action such as continue, modify, terminate the PWL, or proceed with elevated or formal administrative action<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Examiners will refrain from recommending a PWL be reissued, rewritten, or allowed to remain outstanding for long periods (usually no longer than 12 months).</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Recommend removal of the PWL when it is confirmed during a follow-up examination or regular examination the officials have corrected the problem areas and prepare a draft letter for the Regional Director's signature explaining the recommendation</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Recommend escalated administrative action if a credit union has not corrected the problem areas within the timeframes outlined in the PWL<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Escalated administrative action may include a published <a href="../05-LUA/LUA.htm">LUA</a>, Cease and Desist order, <a href="../07-CMP/CMP.htm">civil money penalty</a>, involuntary liquidation, or others. Refer to <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/EnforcementManual.flsnp" />, for processing procedures for civil money penalties, involuntary liquidations, conservatorships, etc.</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document the existence of a PWL in AIRES under Other Administrative Action (in the Administrative Tracking section on the Completion Information tab of the EMC).</li>
        </ul>
