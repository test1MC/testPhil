            <MadCap:concept term="AdminRemedies" /><a name="_Toc410027896"></a>Preliminary Warning Letter</h2>
        <p>Examiners will draft a preliminary warning letter when a credit union’s problems are serious and/or persistent and a credit union’s board is unwilling to sign an LUA. A PWL will support formal administrative action such as a published LUA or C&amp;D order.</p>
        <p>A PWL is a warning of potential formal administrative action if corrective action is not taken. If formal administrative action is taken, then the PWL is automatically removed and all action items in it will be incorporated into the formal administrative action. There may be rare instances where both a PWL and a formal administrative action are necessary to address separate supervisory concerns.</p>
        <p>Examiners will only recommend to their supervisor to issue a PWL as a result of a regular examination, follow-up examination, or onsite supervision contact supported by an AIRES upload. <a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/PWL/PWL Sample.docx">Sample PWLs</a> and a <a href="../../../Resources/APP-AdminRemedies/PWL/BSA-Specific PWL.docx">BSA-specific PWL</a> are provided as resources for this section of the NSPM.</p>
        <p>PWL are written from the perspective of the Regional Director, and include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Direct, concise, and clear language</li>
            <li>A list of the serious area(s) of concern and citation of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/FCUAct.flsnp" /> or regulation violated<ul><li>When the primary problem area is poor management, include the following text:&#160;"Your credit union is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner for which substantial, immediate, and corrective action must be taken. It is the board of directors’ responsibility, as the body providing general direction and control for the credit union, to take necessary corrective actions."</li></ul></li>
            <li>A statement of impending administrative action by the NCUA</li>
            <li>Required actions and timeframes for resolving the area(s) of concern</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>DOS Responsibilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Review PWLs for appropriateness and process for Regional Director approval</li>

            <li>E-mail draft PWL to the supervisor for review and approval within three business days of the examination/supervision completion date<ul><li>The supervisor will review the report to ensure the PWL is appropriate and supported and then forward it to their region’s DOS mailbox within seven business days from the examination/supervision completion date.</li></ul></li>
