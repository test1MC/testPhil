            <MadCap:concept term="Corporates" />Sections <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=44f1efef6408583f92e1bc76c681ff76&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_16&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">704.6(h)</a> and <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=44f1efef6408583f92e1bc76c681ff76&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_110&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">704.10</a> of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> state requirements for an Investment Action Plan (IAP). The NCUA’s expectation is that corporates will maintain the quality of their investment portfolio in accordance with <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=44f1efef6408583f92e1bc76c681ff76&amp;mc=true&amp;n=pt12.7.704&amp;r=PART&amp;ty=HTML" target="_blank">Part 704</a> by evaluating securities, their issuers, and any counterparties in all investment transactions.</p>
        <p>Any corporate in possession of an investment, including a derivative, that fails to meet a requirement of Part 704 must, within 30 calendar days of the failure, report the failed investment to its board of directors, supervisory committee and the ONES director. If the corporate does not sell the failed investment, and the investment continues to fail to meet a requirement of Part 704, the corporate must, within 30 calendar days of the failure, provide the ONES director a written action plan described in <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=44f1efef6408583f92e1bc76c681ff76&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_110&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§704.10</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" />.</p>
        <p>An investment is subject to the requirements of <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=44f1efef6408583f92e1bc76c681ff76&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_110&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§704.10</a> if the following regulatory requirements of <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=44f1efef6408583f92e1bc76c681ff76&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_16&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§704.6</a> have been violated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Appropriate monitoring of investment would reasonably lead to the conclusion that the investment presents more than a minimal amount of credit risk, or</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Investment is part of an asset class or group of investments that exceeds the issuer, sector, or sub-sector concentration limits of §704.6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For purposes of measurement, each new credit transaction must be evaluated in terms of the corporate’s capital at the end of the transaction. An investment that fails a requirement of this section because of subsequent reduction in capital will be deemed non-conforming. Corporates are required to exercise reasonable efforts to bring nonconforming investments into conformity within 90 calendar days. Investments that remain nonconforming for more than 90 calendar days will be deemed to fail a requirement of this section, and the corporate must comply with <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=44f1efef6408583f92e1bc76c681ff76&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_110&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§704.10</a>. </p>
        <p>A corporate with a security that is covered by an IAP is subject to monthly monitoring and reporting requirements.</p>
