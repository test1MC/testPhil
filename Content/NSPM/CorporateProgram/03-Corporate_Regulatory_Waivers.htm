            <MadCap:concept term="Corporates" />Corporate Regulatory Waivers</h2>
        <p>In general, corporate waiver requests will be processed using the following procedures. Refer to each specific waiver type outlined in this section for unique processing steps.</p>
        <h3>Division of Supervision Initial Responsibilities (Review Request)</h3>
        <p>Upon ONES’s receipt of the credit union’s application, DOS will perform a cursory review to determine if the credit union request is complete.</p>
        <p>If a request is complete, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prepare and send an acknowledgement letter&#160; to the corporate using the preferred expedited mail delivery service</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prepare and send a work assignment to the field requesting a recommendation for approval or denial (package includes credit union’s request, application materials, and supporting documentation)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a request is incomplete, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prepare and send an incomplete/denial letter&#160; to the credit union using the preferred expedited mail delivery service<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure the letter lists the additional information the credit union must submit if they would like the request to be considered</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">DOS will copy the examiner and supervisor on the letter</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Field Staff Responsibilities (Review Credit Union)</h3>
        <p>The examiner and his or her supervisor will evaluate the corporate’s management, capital level, CAMEL and risk ratings, and financial strength and provide a recommendation whether to grant the request to DOS for processing. The examiner will scale the scope and depth of the review according to the materiality of the waiver request. With supervisor approval, the examiner will determine if an onsite contact is necessary.</p>
        <p>After review, examiners will determine if the waiver package is complete. If a waiver package is not complete, the examiner will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Draft the appropriate incomplete/denial letter (refer to the <a href="../RegulatoryWaivers/12-Templates-Waivers/Templates-Waivers.htm">templates</a> provided),  or</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Informally contact the credit union to obtain the missing information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a waiver package is complete, the examiner will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Complete a Regional Summary to include an approval or denial recommendation</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Draft a letter for approval, partial approval, deferral, or denial </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Email the approval, partial approval, deferral, or denial letter, the Regional Summary, and any other supporting documentation to their supervisor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If recommending denial, examiners will not discourage any credit union from applying for reconsideration or filing an appeal, if applicable.</p>
        <h3>Supervisor Responsibilities (Process Request)</h3>
        <p>The supervisor will review the information, provide supporting reasons for concurrence or non-concurrence, and forward the package to the ONES mailbox.</p>
        <h3>Division of Supervision Responsibilities (Process Request)</h3>
        <p>Upon receipt of the field’s recommendation, DOS will review and analyze the recommendation for appropriate support and justification. Upon concurrence, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Submit the recommendation and proposed response letter to the director for approval and signature</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Mail the signed letter to the credit union using the preferred expedited mail delivery service (copying the examiner and supervisor)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If DOS and/or the director do not agree with the field’s recommendation, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Notify the supervisor of the reason(s) for the lack of concurrence, giving the field the opportunity to further support or revise their recommendation in the Regional Summary</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Draft revised correspondence</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Finalize the response letter for the director’s signature</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Mail the signed letter to the credit union using the preferred expedited mail delivery service (copying the examiner and supervisor)</li>
        </ul>
