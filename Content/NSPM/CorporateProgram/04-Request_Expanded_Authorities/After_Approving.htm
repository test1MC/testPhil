            <MadCap:concept term="Corporates" />After Approving Corporate Expanded Authority</h3>
        <h4>Monitoring</h4>
        <p>Examiners will ensure the credit union is compliant with the regulations and the requirements for operating under the approved expanded authority.</p>
        <p>During each annual examination, examiners will document compliance with the regulation and investment authority requirements. Failure to maintain compliance will result in the revocation of the expanded authority.</p>
        <h4>Addressing Violations</h4>
        <p>If the examiner identifies a violation of the authorized expanded authority during a subsequent examination, he or she will document the violation in the examination report and treat it as a major concern. The examination will include corrective action including ceasing the activity in violation of the expanded authority, if necessary.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, the DOR will direct the credit union to submit a written plan for resolution to the director. The examiner will evaluate the financial severity or potential risk and make a determination, in consultation with their supervisor, whether to recommend revocation of the expanded authority.</p>
