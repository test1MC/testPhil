        <p>In September 2010, the NCUA Board adopted major revisions to the corporate rule. As part of those revisions, all activities of corporate credit union service organizations (CUSOs) must be preapproved by the NCUA pursuant to <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0774f2e5612d76dbd25d3b83a73f4ce2&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_111&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§704.11</a> of <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Regs/Pages/Regulations.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a>. Two preapproved activities in §704.11(e) are brokerage services (as defined in the <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx#_top?node=17:3.0.1.1.1&amp;rgn=div5" target="_blank">Securities Exchange Act of 1934</a>) and investment advisory services (as defined in the <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title17/17cfr275_main_02.tpl" target="_blank">Investment Advisers Act of 1940</a>). <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/Corps/CCA/Pages/ApprovedCCA.aspx" target="_blank">Approved corporate CUSO activities</a> are presented on the NCUA’s website.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/Corps/CCA/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Corporate CUSO Activities</a> page on the NCUA’s website details a corporate’s responsibilities for complying with <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0774f2e5612d76dbd25d3b83a73f4ce2&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_111&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§704.11(e)</a>, the approval process for requesting additional corporate CUSO activities, and a list of those additional activities that are approved for corporate CUSOs, including reporting requirements and other restrictions on any corporate CUSO which desires to engage in those activities</p>
        <p>The NCUA may occasionally approve additional activities. Once an activity has been approved, any corporate CUSO may engage in it without further approval from the NCUA.</p>
