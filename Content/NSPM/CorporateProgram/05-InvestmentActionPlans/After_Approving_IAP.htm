            <MadCap:concept term="Corporates" />After Approving an Investment Action Plan</h3>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="1. ">Evaluating Investments, Strategy and Policies</h4>
        <p>Examiners and their supervisors are responsible for evaluating a corporate’s investment strategy and policies, as well as the specific investments that resulted in the violation of <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f7487481e89b2eb482b7ff41baabd9c8&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr704_main_02.tpl" target="_blank">Part 704</a> and the need for the corporate to file an IAP. During the evaluation, the examiner should review all pertinent documents, including both pre- and post-purchase analyses. Examiners, through their supervisors, should make a recommendation to the director to approve or deny the investment action plan. Examiners should consult with the assigned ONES capital markets specialist to ensure appropriate analysis and recommendation.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="2. ">Monitoring</h4>
        <p>Examiners will monitor monthly to ensure the corporate is compliant with the regulation and the requirements of any approved IAP. Monitoring will include ensuring that the corporate conducts periodic evaluations to determine the need to continue to hold or sell out of compliance investments.</p>
        <p>During each annual examination, examiners will document compliance with the regulation and approved IAP. Failure of a corporate to maintain compliance and meeting reporting requests may result in revocation of an approved IAP.</p>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="3. ">Addressing Violations</h4>
        <p>If during a subsequent examination the examiner identifies a violation of the approved IAP or additional regulatory violations which were unreported, the examiner will document the violation in the examination report and treat such violation as a major concern. The examination will include corrective action which may include directing the corporate to sell the out of compliance investments.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, the DOR will direct the credit union to submit a written plan for resolution to the director. The examiner will evaluate the financial severity or potential risk and make a determination, in consultation with their supervisor, and the director, whether to recommend revocation of the IAP.</p>
        <p>If the examiner and supervisor determine the violation of the investment authority does not present a heightened material risk to the corporate credit union and believes the corporate credit union will take appropriate corrective action through examination agreements, examiners will document the waiver violation in the Confidential Section, and provide support for the decision not to recommend revocation.</p>
