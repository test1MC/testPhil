        <h4 MadCap:autonum="1. ">Field and Office Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>District examiners are responsible for monitoring compliance with the proper filing and maintenance of a Capital Restoration Plan, or CRP, under <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0c755601544baffc83632629be725ebc&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_14&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§704.4</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" />. The ONES director has delegated authority in the management of the CRP and approval process.</p>
        <p>Any undercapitalized corporate is required to have in place an NCUA-approved CRP. An acceptable CRP must specify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Steps the corporate will take to become adequately capitalized</li>
            <li>Levels of capital to be attained during each year in which the plan will be in effect</li>
            <li>How the corporate will comply with the restrictions or requirements then in effect under PCA</li>
            <li>Types of levels of activities in which the corporate will engage</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="2. ">Division of Supervision Responsibilities</h4>
        <p>Due to the time sensitivity of CRP packages, DOS should perform a cursory review of incoming packages for completeness, making sure all the required information as outlined in <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0c755601544baffc83632629be725ebc&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_14&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§704.4(e)(2)</a> is included.</p>
        <p>For a <b>substantially incomplete package</b>, DOS will draft a letter to request the missing information and return the CRP. </p>
        <p>For a <b>complete package</b>, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare and send a work assignment and with the CRP to the examiner and the supervisor with a required response date at least ten business days before the ONES director’s response deadline</li>
            <li>Prepare and send a letter to the corporate credit union (provide a date by which the director will respond consistent with <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0c755601544baffc83632629be725ebc&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_14&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§704.4(e)(4))</a></li>
