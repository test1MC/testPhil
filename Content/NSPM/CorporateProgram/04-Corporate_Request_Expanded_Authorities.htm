        <h2>Processing Corporate Requests for Expanded Authority</h2>
        <p><a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=117836507b99d9065e34552f479bdf9a&amp;mc=true&amp;node=ap12.7.704_122.b&amp;rgn=div9" target="_blank">Appendix B to Part 704</a> of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> establishes the framework and requirements for managing the additional risk allowed when a corporate applies and is approved for expanded investment authorities. The risks associated with each expanded investment authority are unique; the rule allows a corporate to apply for additional investment authorities it determines is necessary to manage balance sheet risk or to request authority for all expanded authorities.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Corporates" />The NCUA issued <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/Documents/Corp/ExpandAuthGuidelines.pdf" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink">Guidelines for Submission of Requests for Expanded Authority</a> in December 2011 to help corporates and examiners evaluate credit union compliance with expanded investment authorities (Parts I through IV). The guidelines provide additional clarity for the submission of requests for expanded authorities and helps examiners determine the need and qualifications of the credit union that has made a request.</p>
        <p>ONES maintains a list of all approved expanded authorities and will provide the list to E&amp;I upon request.</p>
        <h3>Request Requirements</h3>
        <p>As described in <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=117836507b99d9065e34552f479bdf9a&amp;mc=true&amp;node=ap12.7.704_122.b&amp;rgn=div9" target="_blank">Appendix B to Part 704</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" />, a corporate’s request for an expanded authority waiver must include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Corporate self-assessment plan</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Justification supporting the request</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Draft policies and procedures</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Proposed systems and personnel needed to efficiently and effectively manage the proposed risk activity</li>
        </ul>
