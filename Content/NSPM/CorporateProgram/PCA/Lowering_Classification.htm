            <MadCap:concept term="Corporates" />Lowering a Classification</h3>
        <p>If an examiner recommends lowering a corporate’s capital category to anything lower than “well capitalized” based on an examination or supervision contact, he or she must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Obtain supervisor concurrence for lowering the category</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Note the agreement in the Confidential Section of the report</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document the corrected capital category in the Examination Overview</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the examination or the supervision contact reduces the capital classification to a lower category and a report is not issued to the corporate, the examiner will prepare a draft letter to formally notify credit union officials of the corrected capital category and the required PCA action(s). This should be rare.</p>
        <p>Findings resulting in the lowering of a corporate’s capital category would be significant in most circumstances, warranting an examination report to the corporate’s officials for the administrative record. Modify the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/Net Worth Category Reclassification Samples.docx">Net Worth Category Reclassification samples</a> for use with a corporate credit union. Examiners should forward the draft letter to the ONES mailbox for processing through their supervisor.</p>
