        <h1 MadCap:autonum="Chapter 1. ">Corporate Credit Union Program and Procedures</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Corporates" />The NCUA Board created the Office of National Examinations and Supervision (ONES) in July 2012, leveraging seasoned national examiner and specialist resources to evaluate key risk areas and risk management practices in corporate credit unions and the largest consumer credit unions. ONES is responsible for overseeing corporate credit unions (corporates) and, as of January&#160;1,&#160;2014, consumer credit unions with $10 billion or more in assets.</p>
        <p>This section of the NSPM&#160;describes situations unique to corporates for consideration in fulfilling ONES’s examination and supervision responsibilities.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="1. ">ONES Mission</h2>
        <p>ONES ensures the safety and soundness of all corporates and consumer credit unions with assets of $10 billion or more by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Providing timely and effective advice to the NCUA Board on legislative, regulatory, and operational issues.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Developing, implementing and maintaining examination and supervisory policies and procedures that timely address corporate issues in an evolving financial market.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Effectively managing ONES’s resources, the applicable risk to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and the systemic risk to the credit union system.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 MadCap:autonum="2. ">ONES Policies and Procedures</h2>
        <p>With the exception of circumstances in which <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Regs/Pages/Regulations.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a> (<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f7487481e89b2eb482b7ff41baabd9c8&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr704_main_02.tpl" target="_blank">Part 704</a>) and the related delegated authorities require other processes or procedures, ONES adheres to the policies and practices outlined in the NSPM for its assigned credit unions. ONES staff will follow the general responsibilities, procedures, and requirements in the <a href="../RegulatoryWaivers/Regulatory_Waivers.htm">Regulatory Waivers and other Regulatory Actions</a> section of the NSPM&#160;to process waivers, changes of officials, and other regulatory requests.</p>
        <p>ONES staff should substitute terminology and timeframes as appropriate throughout the NSPM. For example:</p>

                    <th class="TableStyle-Table-Basic-HeadD-Column1-Header1">
                        <p>ONES Equivalent</p>

                </tr>

                </tr>
                <tr class="TableStyle-Table-Basic-Body-Body1">

                    </td>
                    <td class="TableStyle-Table-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1">
                        <p>Call Report 5310</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="TableStyle-Table-Basic-Body-Body1">
                    <td class="TableStyle-Table-Basic-BodyB-Column1-Body1">
                        <p>Quarterly Call Reports, management reporting, trend analysis, etc.</p>
                    </td>
                    <td class="TableStyle-Table-Basic-BodyA-Column1-Body1">
                        <p>Monthly Call Reports, management reporting, trend analysis, etc.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>In instances where ONES is not able to use all of the automated tools for corporate examinations that are available to the regions for consumer credit union examinations, staff should follow existing procedures or processes until corporates are incorporated into the automated systems. For example, ONES staff should use monthly financial analysis of corporate consolidated balance sheet (CBS) trend reports in place of RATE.</p>
