            <MadCap:concept term="Corporates" />Monitoring Corporate CUSOs</h3>
        <p>DOS will maintain a list of corporate CUSOs, approved CUSO activities, and monitor receipt of required quarterly reports as specified on the NCUA website and in the corporate CUSO activity approval letter. The list of corporate CUSOs will be verified with district examiners each quarter to identify changes.</p>
        <p>During a CUSO review, examiners will ensure that a CUSO engages only in approved activities. Examiners may consider activities of wholly-owned CUSOs during the corporate’s annual examination if the activities are included in the examination scope. Examiners are also responsible for validating the corporate CUSOs listed on the CUSO log each quarter.</p>
