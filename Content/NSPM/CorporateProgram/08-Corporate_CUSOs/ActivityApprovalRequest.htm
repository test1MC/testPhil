            <MadCap:concept term="Corporates" />Corporate CUSO Activity Approval Requests</h3>
        <p>In general, ONES will process requests for approval corporate CUSO activities using the following procedures.</p>
        <h4>Initial Review</h4>
        <p>DOS handles preliminary processing of requests for approval of corporate CUSO activities; however, depending on the specific activity submitted and the structure of the corporate CUSO (wholly owned versus minority owned), examiners or specialists and their supervisors may be consulted.</p>
        <p>After ONES receives a corporate CUSO activity request, DOS will perform a cursory review to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine whether the request is complete</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Assess whether they activity is already approved</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Identify whether consultation with the district examiner or a specialized examiner is needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the corporate CUSO activity request is considered complete, DOS will: </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prepare an acknowledgement letter and send it to the corporate or CUSO using the preferred expedited mail delivery service</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Review the request to determine whether it falls under an existing approved corporate CUSO activity<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the request is for an activity that the NCUA has approved for all corporate CUSOs, DOS will prepare an approval letter.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the request is for an activity that has not been approved by the NCUA, DOS will determine if the request meets criteria specified in <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c5b11443ac911c70603ce108007db992&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.704_111&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§704.11</a> of <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Regs/Pages/Regulations.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a> and evaluate the risks associated with the activity. If necessary, DOS will consult with the district examiner, specialized examiner, E&amp;I, or Office of General Counsel. For field consultation, the supervision technician will prepare and send a work assignment to the field that includes the credit union’s request, application package, supporting documentation, and request a recommendation for approval or denial.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the corporate CUSO activity request is considered incomplete, DOS will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prepare an incomplete/denial letter and send it to the credit union or CUSO using the preferred expedited mail delivery</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure the letter lists the additional information the credit union or CUSO must submit if it would like the request to be considered</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Copy the examiner and supervisor on the letter</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Field Staff Review</h4>
        <p>Examiners and/or specialists should review all pertinent documents with their supervisor to evaluate whether the requested activity is appropriate and aligns with the corporate credit union’s business plan, whether the CUSO is currently profitable, and determine if the CUSO has the resources to remain profitable on an ongoing basis. The scope and depth of the examiner’s review will be scaled according to the materiality of the CUSO activity request.</p>
        <p>After review, examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine if additional information is needed (if additional information is required, examiners will informally contact the credit union or CUSO to obtain the missing information)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the activity approval request is considered complete, the examiner will complete a memo to include an approval or denial recommendation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Supervisors will review the information, provide supporting reasons for concurrence or non-concurrence, and forward the package to the ONES mailbox. </p>
        <h4>Processing</h4>
        <p>The delegated authority for approving corporate CUSO activities requires concurrence from E&amp;I and OGC. Upon receipt of the field’s recommendation, DOS will review and analyze the recommendation for appropriate support and justification. Upon concurrence, DOS will endorse the recommendation, provide additional support and justification as needed, and prepare a concurrence request package for the director’s review and approval.</p>
        <p>Once E&amp;I and OGC concurrence are received, DOS will prepare the proposed approval letter and forward it to the director for signature. DOS will mail the signed letter to the credit union using the preferred expedited mail delivery service. DOS will then notify the NCUA webmaster to update the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/Corps/CCA/Pages/ApprovedCCA.aspx" target="_blank">Approved Corporate CUSO Activities</a> webpage.</p>
        <p>If DOS and/or the director do not agree with the field’s recommendation to approve or deny a CUSO activity request, the supervisor will be notified of the reasons. The field will be given the opportunity to provide additional support or justification and revise their recommendation memo.</p>
