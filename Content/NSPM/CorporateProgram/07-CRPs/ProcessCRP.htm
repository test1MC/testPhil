        <h4 MadCap:autonum="1. ">Federal Credit Union CRP</h4>
        <p>Upon receipt of a substantially complete CRP package from a FCU, the examiner will contact the credit union to obtain any additional documentation necessary for processing. </p>
        <p>Examiners and supervisors must analyze the CRP and provide a written recommendation in a <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/Regional Summary of NWRP RBP Review.docx"><a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/Regional Summary of NWRP RBP Review.docx#APPENDIX10C">Regional Summary</a></a>. You can also reference the Corporate Supervisory Instruction 12-01, <i>PCA for Corporate Credit Unions</i>, for additional information.&#160; </p>
        <p>Examiners must submit a draft letter that outlines approval or denial of the CRP to ONES Mail through their supervisor. Employees can modify the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/Approve NWRP RBP.docx">Approve NWRP/RBP</a> and <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/Deny NWRP RBP.docx">Deny NWRP/RBP</a> templates for corporate use. If you recommend denying the plan, the letter must list the specific deficiencies in the plan that warrant denial. ONES DOS should ensure the delivery method of the letter to the credit union includes a signature. </p>
        <h4 MadCap:autonum="2. "> Federally Insured, State-Charted Credit Union CRP</h4>
        <p>A FISCU will submit its CRP to the ONES director and SSA. The processing procedures listed for federal credit unions will apply, along with the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Supervisors will coordinate all related issues directly with the SSA</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Unless submitted directly to ONES, supervisors will obtain documentation of the SSA’s approval or denial</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">DOS will courtesy copy the appropriate SSA on all signed correspondence between the director, DOS, and the FISCU, including any director’s approval or denial letters</li>
        </ul>
