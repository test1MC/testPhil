            <MadCap:concept term="Corporates" />Monitoring a Capital Restoration Plan after Approval</h3>
        <p>Examiners will monitor each corporate operating with a leverage ratio less than four percent and provide their supervisor with a monthly update report (ONES DOS will provide the corporate form (similar to the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/Quarterly PCA Tracking Report.docx#Appendix10G">quarterly PCA tracking report</a>) when needed. Examiners will perform onsite supervision contacts of these credit unions at least quarterly to assess compliance with the PCA and overall capital stability.</p>
        <p>Examiners and their supervisor are responsible for monitoring the level of compliance with the CRP. Examiners should document their compliance review in the Status Update of each examination or follow-up examination report. </p>
        <p>If the examiner determines that the credit union has materially fallen short of the earnings and leverage ratio goals of the plan, examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Instruct the corporate to make adjustments to its financial and operational strategies to come into compliance with the CRP</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When appropriate, advise the corporate to develop and submit a revised CRP, or</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Pursue additional supervisory remedies such as administrative action</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the examiner determines that an existing approved plan is no longer adequate, he or she will send a draft message instructing the credit union to submit a revised plan (use the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/Notify CU of Need to Revise or Replace NWRP.docx">Notify CU of Need to Revise or Replace NWRP</a> memo) to the ONES&#160;mailbox through the supervisor. Documentation will include a comparison of the corporate’s actual performance with its current CRP. The CRP monitoring form provided by DOS outlines a corporate’s action plan and monthly targets for the leverage ratio, earnings, assets, etc., and can be used to document and track the plan’s performance.</p>
        <p>Any findings or concerns relating to the NWRP should be cited in the examination report as appropriate.</p>
