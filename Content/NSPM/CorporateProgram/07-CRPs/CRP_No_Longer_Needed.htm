            <MadCap:concept term="Corporates" />Capital Restoration Plans that are No Longer Needed</h3>
        <p>Once a corporate with a CRP is effectively classified as “adequately capitalized” under PCA and financial projections indicate the ability to remain “adequately capitalized” going forward, it is no longer required to operate under a CRP.&#160; </p>
        <p>Examiners, with the supervisor’s concurrence, will review the corporate credit union’s financial and operational condition, confirm the accuracy of the net worth classification, and draft a memo to the director recommending the CRP be removed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Examiners will include a draft letter advising the credit union of the CRP end date and the need to continue accumulating retaining earnings as required by <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f7487481e89b2eb482b7ff41baabd9c8&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr704_main_02.tpl" target="_blank">Part 704</a> (use the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/Notify CU that NWRP RBP Is No Longer Required.docx">Notify CU that NWRP RBP Is No Longer Required</a> template)<ul><li>The memo will include supervision plans, if necessary, for monitoring PCA compliance (earnings retention) until the credit union becomes “well capitalized.”</li></ul></li>
            <li>Supervisor will review the recommendation and draft letter, and forward it to DOS for processing.</li>
            <li>ONES will issue the letter to credit unions formally acknowledging the CRP is no longer in effect.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the case of FISCUs, the supervisor will contact the SSA to discuss the CRP end date and ongoing supervision plans. The SSA will receive a courtesy copy of the letter notifying the FISCU the CRP is no longer in effect.</p>
