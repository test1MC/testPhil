        <h3>Federal Credit Unions</h3>
        <div class="redacted" MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted">
            <p>Per <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Instruction5001.06.flsnp" />, examiners must ensure all significant violations at federal credit unions are resolved within 90 or fewer days from the examination or contact completion date (upload date).</p>
            <p>Examiners may allow up to 150 days for final resolution for independent testing if the credit union demonstrates adequate progress within 90 days from the examination or contact completion date. However, examiners should not wait until the end of the maximum resolution timeframe to determine whether a credit union is making adequate progress toward resolution.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="BSA" />DOS provides supervisors a report of outstanding BSA violations each quarter. For significant BSA violations outstanding an unreasonable length of time, supervisors should follow-up with examiners to assess the status of corrective action.</p>
        <div class="redacted" MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted">
            <p class="ShadedBox">Each credit union with significant violations must have at least one AIRES file uploaded within the 90- or 150-day timeframe to identify corrections.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="redacted" MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted">
            <p>If inadequate corrective action is noted, escalation of administrative action is required by the NCUA examiner. Staff should refer to the "Failure to take adequate corrective action" section in <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Instruction5001.06.flsnp" />. For example, when credit union compliance with the DOR is inadequate, a PWL or other administrative action must be issued to achieve resolution within 180 days or less from the first date of identification.</p>
        </div>
        <div MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted" class="redacted">
            <p class="ShadedBox">To meet these objectives, examiners need to perform a follow-up contact within 75 days from the examination or contact completion date to assess progress. Such planning will allow sufficient time to draft and process any pending administrative action if necessary.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Based on the severity of the violation, the timeframes for administrative action can be accelerated. Section 206 of the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Documents/fcu_act.pdf"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/FCUAct.flsnp" /></a> contains a list of applicable administrative actions.</p>
        <div class="redacted" MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted">
            <p>On rare occasions, external or uncontrollable events (such as a flood or the resignation of key officials) may delay compliance with written agreements concerning significant BSA violations. Supervisors may request an exception to the progression of administrative action from the Regional Director.</p>
            <p>Examiners must prepare a memo supporting their request to their supervisor. The memo must contain the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Identifying information (including initial identification date of significant BSA violation)</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Timeline for supervision and resolution</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reason for recommending an alternate approach</li>
            </ul>
            <p>No exception approved by the Regional Director may delay the progress of administrative action for more than 90 days after the completion dates presented under the "Failure to take adequate corrective action" section in <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Instruction5001.06.flsnp" />, unless concurrence is received from E&amp;I.</p>
