        <h3>Federally Insured, State-Chartered Credit Unions</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="BSA" />SSAs conduct BSA examinations at FISCUs. Regional Directors may reach agreements with SSAs for NCUA examiners to conduct the BSA examination at FISCUs. These agreements will vary based upon the SSA.</p>
        <div class="redacted" MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted">
            <p>The NCUA collects information about BSA violations in state charters through the Consumer Compliance Violations module and reports to FinCEN along with BSA violations data on federal charters. If the SSA noted BSA violations but did not complete the module, the NCUA examiner must enter the information during their WCC 26 review.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="redacted" MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted">
            <p class="ShadedBox">The 90-day correction timeline outlined in <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../Resources/Snippets/Instruction5001.06.flsnp" /> is not binding for state charters. However, maintaining an adequate BSA program is a condition of federal insurance and we expect SSAs to adequately and promptly deal with significant violations.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The NCUA has the enforcement authority for FISCUs examined by the NCUA (SSA has authority to review). “Examined” refers specifically to WCC 11s. If, during another type of contact, an NCUA examiner identifies unresolved BSA concerns or concerns not identified by the SSA, he or she should expand the scope of the review to include BSA and follow up to ensure BSA resolution.</p>
        <p>During joint examinations, NCUA examiners can allow the SSA to review BSA, but the NCUA examiner must review the SSA’s work for sufficiency. If the review performed by the SSA is insufficient, the NCUA examiner should amend the review. The NCUA examiner must also ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Consumer Compliance Violations module includes the appropriate regulation for BSA violations</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Required BSA questionnaires are completed</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Consumer Compliance Violations module and BSA questionnaires are included in the NCUA WCC 11 or WCC 23 examination upload</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a state report lacks adequate agreements for corrective action or the SSA is not adequately resolving the issue(s), examiners will recommend the supervisor (or Regional Director) communicate with the state, take appropriate action, and document the outcome in a memo to DOS. For significant BSA violations outstanding an unreasonable length of time, supervisors should follow up with the respective SSA to assess the status of corrective action. In rare instances, examiners may need to contact the credit union directly to assess resolution status. As a last resort, examiners should discuss with their supervisor as to whether formal correspondence to the SSA is required.</p>
