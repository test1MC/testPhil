            <MadCap:concept term="BSA" />BSA Enforcement</h2>
        <p>When an examiner identifies material BSA program deficiencies and/or compliance violations, targeted enforcement will be implemented to resolve supervisory concerns timely. In implementing enforcement action, examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Attempt to have the credit union resolve deficiencies during the examination process</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document the review using the AIRES BSA questionnaire, examination scope, and supporting work papers as needed</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Identify, track, and resolve significant BSA violations - this includes issuing a PWL or similar administrative action as necessary</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Complete the Consumer Compliance Violations module in AIRES with the appropriate citation if applicable (report all significant BSA violations as regulation code BSA-S)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Discuss BSA violations in the open section of the report</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prepare a DOR, if applicable</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Indicate the appropriate level of compliance and other risks in the Scope module</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Ensure the adequacy of the credit union’s BSA program is considered when assessing and rating management</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted" class="redacted">Follow-up with the credit union to achieve resolution of significant BSA violations within 90 days of the examination completion date (or 150 days for a structured resolution like independent testing)</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted" class="redacted">Complete the FinCEN.doc form within AIRES when a significant BSA violation involves a data quality violation or a BSA-related administrative action is in place for an FCU</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Document resolution of BSA violations through the Consumer Compliance Violations module in AIRES</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Report discovery of money laundering activities or other high profile BSA violations to DOS through their supervisor</li>
        </ul>
