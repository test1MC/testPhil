        <h3 MadCap:autonum="A. ">When to File an SAR</h3>
        <p>Credit unions are required by federal regulations to file a SAR with respect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Criminal violations involving insider abuse in any amount</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Criminal violations aggregating $5,000 or more when a suspect can be identified</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Criminal violations aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of potential suspect</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Transactions conducted or attempted by, at, or through the credit union and aggregating $5,000 or more, if the credit union knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect that the transaction:<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">May involve potential money laundering or other illegal activity (for example, terrorism financing)</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;"><MadCap:concept term="BSA" />Is designed to evade the BSA or its implementing regulations</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Has no business or apparent lawful purpose or it not the type of transaction that the particular member would normally be expected to engage in, and the credit union knows of no reasonable explanation for the transaction after examining the available facts, including the background and possible purpose of the transaction</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 MadCap:autonum="B. ">SAR Filing Information</h3>
        <p>Credit unions must file all SARs electronically through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) <a href="http://bsaefiling.fincen.treas.gov/main.html" target="_blank">BSA E-Filing website</a>.</p>
        <p>The SAR rules require that a SAR be filed no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the initial detection of facts that may constitute a basis for filing a SAR. For situations requiring immediate attention, the credit union should immediately notify the appropriate law enforcement authority in addition to filing a timely SAR. If the credit union suspects that a transaction may be linked to terrorist activity, the credit union should immediately call the FinCEN Financial Institutions Hotline at (800) 556-3974.</p>
        <p>Examiners: will review SAR filing processes during examination/supervision contacts and focus their review on the credit union’s’ process for detecting suspicious activity. Examiners will also review newly filed SARs for appropriateness and compliance with FinCEN’s regulation. Should the officials fail to act, examiners will notify their supervisor. The supervisor will notify the ARDP who will consult with OGC regarding appropriate administrative action.</p>
        <p>E&amp;I will periodically review significant SAR filings to identify potential national risk trends.</p>
