        <h2>Requesting a Currency Transaction Report, Suspicious Activity Report, or Designation of Exempt Persons History</h2>
        <p>Examiners can request a list of the CTRs, SARs, and DOEPs a credit union has filed by sending an e-mail to the regional DOS mailbox with the full name, address, and credit union Employer Identification Number (EIN). When requesting a download from DOS, examiners should include a specific timeframe for the request (for example, Jan. 1, 2011&#160;–&#160;Oct.&#160;1,&#160;2011).</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="BSA" />Examiners may obtain the list of CTRs, DOEPs, and SARs filed by a credit union before starting an examination as a scoping tool for the BSA review. A change in filings (decrease or increase) could be an indicator of a problem and may require attention during the examination. The information may be sorted in various ways to enable examiners to identify trends of certain customers or accounts, which could warrant further review during the examination.</p>
        <p>Examiners should also verify that the credit union has actually filed CTRs or SARs with the appropriate agency, particularly when there is insider activity.</p>

            <p class="ShadedBox">The FinCEN worksheet may not to be shared with the credit union due to the confidentiality requirements noted in the regulation.<br /><br />SARs are confidential. Any credit union, including its officials, employees, and agents are prohibited from disclosing a SAR or the information in a SAR, or providing any information which would disclose that a SAR was prepared or filed, except when such disclosure is requested by FinCEN or an appropriate law enforcement or federal banking agency. Such reports, or the fact they have been filed, may not be disclosed by a government employee to any person involved in the transaction, “other than as necessary to fulfill the official duties of such officer or employee.” 31 U.S.C. 5318 (g)(2)(ii). Unauthorized release of information collected under the BSA may result in criminal or civil sanctions.</p>
