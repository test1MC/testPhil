        <h3>AIRES Consumer Compliance Violations Module</h3>
        <p>Examiners must complete the Consumer Compliance Violations module in AIRES for BSA violations that have been identified during the examination/supervision contact. In completing the module, examiners should:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Combine multiple violations of the same regulation into a single citation within the module.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Utilize the CFR citation over the equivalent NCUA regulatory citation wherever possible.</li>
            <li>Identify all significant BSA violations as “BSA-S” in the Regulation code column.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted" class="redacted">
                <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted">Use the <a href="BSA_Citations/BSA_Citations.htm">BSA citation verbiage provided in the NSPM</a>. Keep comments brief, and exclude any confidential information like names or account numbers - the information entered in the module is reported outside of the NCUA.</MadCap:conditionalText>
            </li>
            <li>Identify the management response taken using the drop-down menu within the module. These responses play a critical role in the regional office’s tracking of resolved BSA-S violations.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="redacted" MadCap:conditions="Redaction.Redacted">
            <p class="ShadedBox">Compliance violations documented during prior examinations (resolved and unresolved) will flow into the current examination on the Consumer Compliance Violations module and will be summarized in the EMC.<br /><br />Because the Consumer Compliance Violations module is the NCUA’s primary means of collecting and reporting data to FinCEN, the Government Accountability Office, Congress, etc., it is critical examiners complete this module accurately.</p>

        <h4>BSA Violations in Corporate Credit Unions</h4>
        <p>For examinations of corporate credit unions, ONES examiners will include BSA violations in examination reports as examiner findings or documents of resolution, as appropriate using the general guidelines in this section of the NSPM. ONES will manually report corporate BSA violations to E&amp;I each month using an approved spreadsheet.</p>
