            <h3>Data Quality Violations</h3>
            <p>A data quality violation involves the failure to collect or report information to FinCEN through a SAR or CTR. Not filing any quantity of CTRs remains significant and may qualify as a systemic or pervasive violation. However, unfiled CTRs are only classified as a data quality violation when more than 25 percent are not filed.</p>
            <p>To be classified as a data quality violation, one of the following criteria must be met:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One or more SARs were needed, but not submitted/filed by the credit union</li>
                <li>Un-filed CTRs equal 25 percent or more of the total CTRs filed during the period reviewed by the examiner</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <MadCap:concept term="BSA" />A BSA report excerpt must always be completed for a data quality violation (see the <a href="../05-AIRES_FinCEN/AIRES_FinCEN.htm">AIRES FinCEN.doc section</a> of the NSPM). If the number of unfiled CTRs is not determined during the examination, the unfiled CTRs must be treated as a significant data quality violation.</p>
