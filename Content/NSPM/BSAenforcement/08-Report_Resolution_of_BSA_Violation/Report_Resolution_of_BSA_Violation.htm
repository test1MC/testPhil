            <MadCap:concept term="BSA" />Reporting the Resolution of a BSA Violation</h2>
        <p>Examiners must supervise a credit union’s progress to ensure the timely resolution of significant BSA violations. Resolution encompasses the correction of the noted BSA violation(s) and the implementation of adequate controls to mitigate the potential for similar violations.</p>
        <p>When significant BSA violations have been adequately corrected, examiners must upload an AIRES file with the Consumer Compliance Violations module properly completed.</p>
