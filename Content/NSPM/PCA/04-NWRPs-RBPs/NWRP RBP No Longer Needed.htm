        <h3>NWRP/RBP that are No Longer Needed</h3>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="PCA" />Once a non-new credit union with a NWRP is effectively classified as “adequately capitalized” under PCA and successfully remains so for four consecutive calendar quarters, the credit union is no longer required to operate under a NWRP and the NWRP is no longer in effect.</p>
        <p>A new credit union’s RBP remains in effect until they are no longer considered new (i.e., the credit union has been in operation more than ten years or has assets greater than $10 million).</p>
        <p>Examiners, with the SE’s concurrence, will review the credit union’s financial and operational condition, confirm the accuracy of the net worth classification, and draft a memo to the Regional Director confirming the NWRP or RBP is no longer in effect.</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Your memo will include a draft letter advising the credit union that the NWRP&#160;is ending. (Use the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/Notify CU that NWRP RBP Is No Longer Required.docx">Notify Credit Union that NWRP RBP Is No Longer Required</a> template.)&#160;</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Your memo will include supervision plans, if necessary, for monitoring PCA compliance (earnings retention) until the credit union becomes “well capitalized.”<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">In the case of FISCUs, the supervisor will contact the SSA to discuss the NWRP/RBP ending and ongoing supervision plans. The SSA will receive a courtesy copy of the letter notifying the FISCU the NWRP/RBP is no longer in effect.</li></ul></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The supervisor will review the recommendation and the draft letter and forward to DOS for processing.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The regional office will issue the letter to credit unions formally acknowledging the NWRP/RBP is no longer in effect.</li>
        </ul>
