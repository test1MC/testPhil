        <h3>Monitoring NWRPs and RBPs after Approval</h3>
        <p>Examiners will monitor each credit union operating with a net worth ratio less than 6 percent and provide their supervisor with a <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/Quarterly PCA Tracking Report.docx#Appendix10G"><MadCap:concept term="PCA" />quarterly PCA&#160;tracking report</a>. Examiners will perform onsite supervision contacts of these credit unions to assess compliance with PCA and overall net worth stability.</p>
        <p>Examiners and their supervisor are responsible for monitoring the level of compliance with the NWRP/RBP. Examiners should document their compliance review in the Status Update of each examination or follow-up examination report.</p>
        <p>If the review determines the credit union has materially fallen short of the earnings and net worth ratio goals of the plan, examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Instruct the credit union to make adjustments to financial and operational strategies to come into compliance with the NWRP/RBP</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Advise, when appropriate, the credit union to develop and submit a revised NWRP/RBP, or</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Pursue additional supervisory remedies, such as administrative action.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the review determines the existing, approved plan is no longer adequate, examiners will send an e-mail (through their supervisor) to their region’s DOS mailbox along with a draft Regional Director letter (use the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/Notify CU of Need to Revise or Replace NWRP.docx">Notify CU of Need to Revise or Replace NWRP</a> template)&#160;instructing the credit union to submit a revised plan.</p>
        <p>Documentation will include a comparison of the credit union’s actual performance with its current NWRP/RBP. The <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/Quarterly PCA Tracking Report.docx#Appendix10G">quarterly PCA tracking report</a> outlines a credit union’s action plan and quarterly NWRP/RBP targets for net worth ratio, earnings transfer, assets, etc. and can be used to document and track the plan’s performance.</p>
        <p>Any findings or concerns relating to the NWRP should also be cited in the examination report as appropriate.</p>
