            <MadCap:concept term="PCA" />Net Worth Restoration Plans and Revised Business Plans</h2>
        <p>District examiners are responsible for monitoring compliance with the proper filing and maintenance of a net worth restoration plan under <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=08a307da99a24051ccd8646e77eb30c4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.702_1206&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§702.206</a> and a revised business plan under <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=08a307da99a24051ccd8646e77eb30c4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.702_1306&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§702.306</a>. Regional Directors have delegated authority in the management of the NWRP and RBP approval process.</p>
        <p>Credit unions with a net worth ratio less than six percent are required to have in place an NCUA-approved NWRP or, in the case of new credit unions, an initial business plan or a RBP. Credit unions classified as complex per <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=08a307da99a24051ccd8646e77eb30c4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.702_1103&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§702.103</a> also need to meet a risk based net worth requirement, and if their RBNW requirement exceeds their net worth ratio they are classified as undercapitalized.</p>
        <p>A NWRP/RBP questionnaire is available in AIRES. A <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/NWRP RBP and Assumptions Workbook Sample.docx#APPENDIX10B">sample NWRP/RBP and assumptions workbook</a> is available in the NSPM. NCUA’s Office of Small Credit Union Initiatives is available to assist new credit unions with RBPs, and to assist credit unions that have less than $10 million in assets with NWRPs. <br /></p>
        <p class="ShadedBox"> An eligible credit union can request OSCUI assistance by completing the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Resources/OSCUI/Documents/ConsultNomination.pdf" target="_blank">Consulting Nomination Form</a> and checking the NWRP box in the Immediate Services Requested section of the form.</p>
