            <MadCap:concept term="PCA" />Failure to Submit an NWRP/RBP</h3>
        <p>DOS will monitor credit unions that fail to submit a NWRP/RBP and contact the supervisor for a status report when the NWRP/RBP is not received by the due date.</p>
        <p>When any credit union fails to timely file the NWRP, examiners will draft a Regional Director letter (use the <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/Notify CU of Need to Submit NWRP RBP.docx">Notify Credit Union of Need to Submit NWRP/RBP</a> template), through their supervisor. The Regional Director letter will give the credit union 15 calendar days from the receipt of the notice to submit the NWRP in accordance with <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=08a307da99a24051ccd8646e77eb30c4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.702_1206&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§702.206(a)(4)</a>. The supervisor will submit the letter to DOS Mail within three business days of receipt. FISCUs may require SSA consultation.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">Sometimes credit unions may be in the process of or choose to seek a merger. The Regional Director can agree to accept a merger plan in lieu of a NWRP/RBP. However, the Regional Director’s approval should be subject to the credit union filing an acceptable merger plan or NWRP by a reasonable but specific deadline.<br /><br />If the merging credit union is critically undercapitalized or undercapitalized the deadline should be set to ensure compliance with <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=08a307da99a24051ccd8646e77eb30c4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.702_1204&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§702.204</a> or <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=08a307da99a24051ccd8646e77eb30c4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.702_1305&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§702.305</a>.</p>
