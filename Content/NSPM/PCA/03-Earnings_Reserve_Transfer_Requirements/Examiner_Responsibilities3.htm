            <li>Review the accuracy and adequacy of the quarterly net worth increases and reserve transfers since the last supervision contact during examinations and follow-up examinations</li>
            <li>Determine if it is probable that an FICU will need to request an earnings retention waiver for the current or foreseeable quarters during the course of any examination, follow-up examination, or other supervision activity<ul><li>If a credit union is likely to need to request an earnings retention waiver, you must address this issue in the examination report. Your supervision plans must incorporate adequate follow-up to ensure earnings retention waiver requests are filed timely.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Document the violation in the exam report if you determine that a FICU failed to meet the earnings retention requirements for one or more of the previous quarters during the course of an examination, follow-up examination, or other supervision activity<ul><li>The NCUA can take supervisory or other enforcement action against credit unions that either decrease their earnings retention without permission or persistently fail to file their waiver requests timely.

            <li>Prepare a brief memo outlining your findings and forward it to your supervisor if you identify a federal credit union that failed to meet its earnings retention requirements did not seek a waiver (<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=08a307da99a24051ccd8646e77eb30c4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.702_1201&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§702.201</a>) through supervision activity outside of an examination or follow-up examination<ul><li>Include a draft letter that notifies the officials of the credit union’s violation for the Regional Director’s signature. The supervisor will e-mail the memo and draft letter to DOS Mail for processing.</li></ul></li>
            <li>In a joint FISCU exam, examiners should consult with their SE and work with the SSA to ensure the exam addresses the credit union’s failure to meet its earnings retention requirements without a waiver<ul><li>If the problem is recognized through other supervision activity, you will follow the procedures outlined in the NSPM&#160;and work with the SE to contact the SSA alerting them of the regulatory violation before the notification letter is sent to the FISCU. The SSA will also be copied on the notification letter.</li></ul></li>
