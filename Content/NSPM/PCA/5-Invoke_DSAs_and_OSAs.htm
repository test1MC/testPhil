        <h2>Invoking Discretionary Supervisory Actions and Other Corrective Actions for a Critically Undercapitalized Credit Union</h2>
        <h3>Discretionary Supervisory Actions</h3>
        <p>NCUA Instruction 3500.01, <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Directives/Instructions/3501.01.pdf" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink"><MadCap:concept term="PCA" />Discretionary Supervisory Actions (DSAs) under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)</a> addresses national policy for processing a DSA.</p>
        <p>For DSAs, examiners will submit through their supervisor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A <a href="../../Resources/APP-PCA/Regional Summary of DSA RD Approval.docx#appendix10J">Regional Summary</a></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The credit union’s most recent balance sheet and income statement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>DOS will review and process the action for Regional Director approval (and NCUA Board approval if necessary).</p>
        <h3>Other Corrective Actions for Critically Undercapitalized Credit Unions</h3>
        <p>For critically undercapitalized credit unions, the NCUA may approve other corrective action in lieu of conservatorship or liquidation (<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d4b98fdcf43fd01b114f560a02b7585e&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.702_1204&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§702.204(c)</a>). The Regional Director has delegated authority to approve OCA for credit unions with assets less than $5 million. The NCUA Board approval as well as concurrence from the Office of Examination and Insurance is required for credit unions greater than $5 million in assets.</p>
        <h4>Processing</h4>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/EnforcementManual.flsnp" />, addresses the required contents of OCA packages. For OCA requiring Regional Director approval only, use the <a href="../../Resources/APP-PCA/Regional Summary of OCA RD Approval.docx">Regional Summary of OCA RD Approval</a> template.</p>
        <h4>Timing of Submission</h4>
        <p>Timing of these submissions is critical, especially when NCUA Board approval is required. The NCUA has 90 days from the effective date the credit union became critically undercapitalized to approve OCA. The region is responsible for submitting the BAM and obtaining concurrence from E&amp;I and OGC within completion due dates for Board actions.</p>
        <h4>FISCUs</h4>
        <p>Joint actions with the SSA are preferred for FISCUs. However, examiners can recommend actions without SSA concurrence, if necessary. You should note the concurrence or non-concurrence of the SSA in the Regional Summary.</p>
