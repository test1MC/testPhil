        <p>Due to the complex analysis necessary for a Risk Mitigation Credit, regions will need to seek the assistance of the appropriate level of expertise within the NCUA. This includes E&amp;I with experience in processing prior risk mitigation credits, specific program officers, and senior capital market specialists.</p>
        <h3>Processing Responsibilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>DOS will review a request for a Risk Mitigation Credit for complete information. If the information submitted is incomplete or inadequate, DOS will request additional information. The Regional Director has 45 days from the receipt of a complete application to respond to the credit union's request for a Risk Mitigation Credit. DOS will coordinate participation of NCUA staff experts with the region. DOS will forward complete requests to the examiner, through their supervisor, for review, concurrence and a recommendation for approval or denial. Examiners will document sufficient analysis to support the recommended action.</li>
            <li>Examiners will prepare a memo summarizing the application and make a recommendation for approval or denial. The supervisor will review the package and forward it to DOS indicating their concurrence or non-concurrence with the examiner’s recommendation. DOS will then review and process the action for Regional Director approval after determining the examiner has provided sufficient support and documentation for the administrative record.</li>
        </ul>
