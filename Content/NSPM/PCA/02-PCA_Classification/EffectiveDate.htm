        <h3>Effective Date of Classification</h3>
        <p>The effective date of the net worth classification (<a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=08a307da99a24051ccd8646e77eb30c4&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.702_1101&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§702.101(b)</a>) is the most recent of the:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Last day of the calendar month following the end of the calendar quarter (determined by the 5300 Call Report filing and the most typical effective date)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Date the credit union received subsequent written notice from the NCUA or, if state-chartered, the appropriate SSA, of:<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">a decline in net worth category due to a correction of an error or misstatement in the credit union’s most recent Call Report</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">a reclassification to a lower net worth category on safety and soundness grounds</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are recommending lowering the credit union’s net worth category to less than well capitalized based on an examination or supervision contact, you must complete the following actions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Obtain your supervisor’s concurrence, note the agreement in the Confidential Section of the AIRES report, and document the corrected net worth category in the Examination Overview.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <MadCap:concept term="PCA" />If the examination or the supervision contact reduces net worth to a lower category, and you are not issuing a report to the credit union, prepare a draft letter to formally notify credit union officials of the corrected net worth category and the required PCA action(s). This should be rare. Your findings to lower a credit union’s net worth category would be significant in most circumstances, making an AIRES report to the officials warranted for the administrative record. (See <a href="../../../Resources/APP-PCA/NWRP RBP/Net Worth Category Reclassification Samples.docx">sample Regional Director letters</a>.) Forward the draft letter through your supervisor to the regional DOS mailbox for processing.</li>
        </ul>
