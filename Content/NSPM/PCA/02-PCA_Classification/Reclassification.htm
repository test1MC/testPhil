        <p>The effective date of an examination or supervision contact-based correction to a net worth category varies depending on whether the credit union is federally chartered or state-chartered:</p>

                        <p>NCUA&#160;examiners should consult and work cooperatively with the appropriate state supervisory authority (SSA)&#160;official before correcting a net worth category of a FISCU. NCUA examiners will promptly notify the appropriate SSA of its decision to correct a net worth category. The effective date will depend on whether it was an independent or joint examination:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Effective date of classification for an independent examination completed by the SSA:&#160;when the SSA releases its official examination report</li>
                            <li>Effective date of classification for a joint examination, where the NCUA EIC is aware the SSA will be providing a timely examination report to the FISCU:&#160;when the SSA releases its official examination report</li>
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">For joint examinations in which the SSA may not release its examination report for several months, or in the event of an independent insurance review completed by the NCUA, follow the same procedure used for FCUs (i.e., through a notification letter) but give the SSA an opportunity to review the draft notification letter before it is issued and copy the SSA on the final letter.</li>
