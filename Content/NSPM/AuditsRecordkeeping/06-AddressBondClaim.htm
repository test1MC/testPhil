            <MadCap:concept term="Audits" />Addressing Bond Claims</h2>
        <p>If the credit union has a bondable loss and has not provided the appropriate notice to the surety company or refuses to do so, examiners will notify their supervisor. The supervisor will discuss the issue with the ARDP or ARDO as appropriate and a decision will be made regarding the NCUA notifying the surety company of a potential bond claim.</p>
        <p>During contacts, examiners should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine whether a bond claim is outstanding, established as a disclosure item (footnote to the financial statements) or a receivable, remains on the books as a loan, other account, or a disclosure, or has been written off</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine whether the surety company has committed to paying the claim; and, if so, the amount of the commitment</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Direct the credit union to write off any claims, or portions of claims, considered losses even if this will cause a deficit or insolvency. In evaluating the collectability of claims, examiners will consider:<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Surety companies do not pay for lost interest or lost opportunity income</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">The credit union must have incurred a loss for a valid claim to exist</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">An examiner’s adjusting journal entries in AIRES must properly reflect the bond claim as an accounts receivable, or loss, after the surety bond company has confirmed the outcome of the claim in writing</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examiners should contact their supervisor when they identify material bond claims or when adjusting entries will cause a deficit in undivided earnings or insolvency. At a minimum, examiners should document shortages in the scope and other sections as appropriate.</p>
