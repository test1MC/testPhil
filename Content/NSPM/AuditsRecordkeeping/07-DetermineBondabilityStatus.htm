            <MadCap:concept term="Audits" />Determine Bondability Status</h2>
        <p>In some instances, it may be necessary to determine the bondability status of a credit union employee or official. This procedure is usually reserved for fraud, insider dealings, or when we have completed a prohibition and want to check if the individual’s bond has been revoked (open claims typically will not yet have a determination, especially if no criminal charges are involved).</p>
        <p>Examiners will work with the appropriate credit union staff to determine the bondability status of a credit union employee or official. Examiners may also evaluate the credit union’s process for verifying bondability of all employees. Credit unions should be evaluating each employee during the hiring process to ensure they are bondable and maintain a record of this verification to provide to NCUA examiners (and other outside auditors) when requested. If a credit union has not completed this process and/or cannot provide documentation, the examiner should address the issue in the examination report, as appropriate.</p>
