            <MadCap:concept term="Audits" />Audit Report Review</h2>
        <p>Field staff are responsible for reviewing a credit union’s Profile each quarter during the <a href="../DistrictMgmt/07-Call_Report_Trending_Analysis_RATE/Field_Responsibilities.htm">Call Report or RATE review</a> to determine whether the credit union has received a new audit which fulfills the requirements of <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b0b908203b996f5c2e554a40e83c8260&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt12.7.715&amp;rgn=div5" target="_blank">Part 715</a> or <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=b0b908203b996f5c2e554a40e83c8260&amp;mc=true&amp;node=pt12.7.741&amp;rgn=div5" target="_blank">Part 741</a> of the NCUA’s rules and regulations. If the Profile indicates a new audit has been completed, field staff will request a copy of the audit within 10 business days of reviewing the Profile. </p>
        <h3>Obtaining an Audit Report</h3>
        <p>For audits performed by the <b>supervisory committee</b>, examiners will obtain the audit report directly from the supervisory committee.</p>
        <p>For audits conducted by <b>external auditors</b>, examiners need to obtain a copy of the audit report directly from the external auditor.  Unless there is an existing arrangement between the credit union, field staff, and the auditor, or an existing working relationship field staff has with the auditor, field staff should first contact the supervisory committee to determine the supervisory committee’s preference for making the request of the external auditor - that is, would the supervisory committee prefer to make the request, or needs to because the audit firm will not release the audit report otherwise, or is it okay for field staff to contact the auditor directly to make the request.</p>
        <p> In either case, the external auditor needs to send the audit report directly to the examiner.  If an auditor refuses to provide an audit report directly to the examiner, even at the request of the supervisory committee, or wants to charge a fee to provide a copy, examiners should consult with their supervisor regarding a course of action (such as ensuring the credit union is okay with the fee or scheduling a meeting with the auditor to review the audit).</p>
        <h3>Reviewing the Audit Report</h3>
        <p>Upon receiving the report, field staff will read the audit report to determine if there are any problems with the credit union.  Field staff should adjust supervision plans and exam scoping as applicable, and follow up on any material problems identified by discussing them with the supervisory committee or credit union management and/or scheduling a supervision contact as warranted.  
</p>
        <p><b>A review of the audit workpapers is not required as part of the review of the audit report required under this policy.</b>  As part of offsite supervision or pre-exam planning, the NCUA has the discretion to request and review the audit workpapers at any time – however, the external auditor may require them to be reviewed onsite.</p>
        <p>The time associated with requesting and reviewing an audit report under this policy can be charged to offsite supervision or pre-exam planning.
</p>
        <h3>Documenting the Audit Report</h3>
        <p>Field staff will document that they have reviewed the audit report in the credit union’s RATE during the scheduled RATE review cycle.  If field staff receive a requested audit report after the RATE review cycle closes, they should document their review in the next scheduled RATE review cycle.  If an audit report relays material concerns that require an immediate onsite contact, examiners should note the concerns in the RATE review and contact their supervisor to schedule an onsite contact.</p>
        <p>Examiners may also upload an offsite supervision contact in AIRES to document any concerns noted in the audit report that cannot be fully documented in RATE, provided such issues do not require an immediate onsite contact.</p>
