            <MadCap:concept term="Audits" />Audit Firms Located Outside the Geographic Area</h2>
        <p>Per <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f7487481e89b2eb482b7ff41baabd9c8&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.715_110&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§715.10</a> of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" />, the SC is responsible for preparing and maintaining, or making available, a complete set of original working papers supporting each supervisory committee audit. The SC will, upon request, provide NCUA staff unconditional access to such working papers, either at the offices of the credit union or at a mutually agreeable location, for purposes of inspecting such working papers.</p>
        <p>In the event the audit firm is located outside the geographic area of the credit union and the examiner determines it would be advantageous for another region and/or group to review the audit work papers at the firm’s office, examiners will request assistance from another group or region through the supervisor. Examiners from the requested supervisor group will be responsible for reviewing the independent state-licensed accountant’s audit work papers and providing a report summarizing the review to the EIC.</p>
