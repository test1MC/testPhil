            <MadCap:concept term="Audits" />Audits by Licensed Independent Accountants </h2>
        <p>Examiners cannot take independent action in the event a financial statement audit by a state licensed independent accountant is unacceptable. NCUA Instruction 4016.01, <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Directives/Instructions/4016.01.pdf" target="_blank" class="ItalicHyperlink">Obtaining Concurrence and Advancing an Assertion That an Opinion Audit or Agreed-Upon Procedures are Unacceptable in Meeting NCUA Audit Regulations</a>, sets out procedures required to rate a state licensed independent accountant audit unacceptable and requires Regional Director approval and E&amp;I concurrence. The supervisor will evaluate the seriousness of the deficiency and if it is sufficient to warrant a rejection of the audit, the supervisor will contact the regional office and proceed in accordance with NCUA Instruction 4016.01.</p>
        <p class="ShadedBox">An examiner can take exception with the Supervisory Committee if the state licensed independent accountant performed agreed upon procedures rather than a financial statement audit, in the circumstance that the scope of work for which the Supervisory Committee contracted does not meet the requirements of <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f7487481e89b2eb482b7ff41baabd9c8&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr715_main_02.tpl" target="_blank">Part 715</a> of <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /> or the Supervisory Committee Guide minimum procedures.</p>
        <p>If the licensed independent accountant denies access to the work papers, examiners will contact the SC chairman to report the situation and ask for assistance in resolving the problem. If unsuccessful, examiners will contact the supervisor for guidance. Examiners should never sign any document or release to gain access to the work papers unless OGC has reviewed the release and advises signature. E&amp;I can assist examiners and supervisors in obtaining OGC review in a timely fashion.</p>
