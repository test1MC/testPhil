        <h2>Significant Recordkeeping Concerns</h2>
        <p>Significant recordkeeping concerns include any other issue that presents an unacceptable degree of risk including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Incomplete bank reconcilements or over 60 days in arrears</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Records materially in arrears or significant unreconciled differences (including AIRES share and loan download not tying back to member trial balance)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a name="When"></a>When an examination or supervision contact reveals significant recordkeeping concerns, examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Notify their supervisor</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Review material general ledger accounts including, but not limited to, loans, member deposits, cash, investments, subsidiary ledgers, and the Call Report</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Rate transaction risk as “high,” or document the rationale for a different risk rating</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Denote this as a major concern in the Examination Overview</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Prepare a detailed DOR, using the DOR module, with a resolution date of 180 days or less (for FISCUs, also provide the DOR to the SSA prior to completion of the contact)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Require the SC/designated person to provide monthly status reports electronically or by phone<ul><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reports should note the progress made to remedy the recordkeeping problems</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Examiners will maintain a <a href="../../Resources/APP-DistrictMgmt/Supervision Chronology Report.docx#appendix1a">Supervision Chronology Report</a> of these contacts to be included in subsequent AIRES uploads (and for submission to their supervisor, if requested)</li></ul></li>
            <li>Conduct an onsite follow-up supervision contact within 90 days of the NCUA’s last contact completion date and an onsite supervision contact every 90 days thereafter, until all problems are resolved<ul><li>The supervisor must approve any extension beyond 90 days in writing and notify the ARDP and DOS</li><li>The examiner must document any extensions in the Confidential Section</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Incomplete Bank Reconcilements or Over 60 Days in Arrears </h3>
        <p>If the bank or corporate reconcilements are incomplete (unreconciled) or in arrears greater than 60 calendar days, in addition to the steps outlined in the previous section, examiners will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Determine the cause and evaluate the scope of the potential problem</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Reach agreements with management to bring the reconcilements current, usually within 30 calendar days, and involve the SC in this process</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Consider requiring an outside independent accountant to bring reconcilements current, especially if the SC is not active or does not possess the skills to adequately review the bank reconcilement process</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Records Materially In Arrears or Significant Unreconciled Differences</h3>
        <p>Examiners must use judgment in assessing material recordkeeping problems. In some cases, the size of the unreconciled differences may not reflect the scope of the problem, particularly if the control environment lacks integrity. If records are materially in arrears or there are significant unreconciled differences, examiners will discuss with their supervisor whether to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extend the examination/supervision contact up to 30 calendar days if the records cannot be brought current during the examination. If this option is taken, examiners will note the reasons why the examination was extended and the supervisor's concurrence in the Confidential Section; or</li>
            <li>Complete the examination using the most current data available. If this option is taken, examiners will note in the Confidential Section whether officials agreed to the correct recordkeeping concerns.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This discussion is in addition to the <a href="#When">steps examiners should take for a credit union that has significant recordkeeping concerns</a> listed above.</p>
        <p>If the recordkeeping problems are serious and persistent as defined in <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=bfbee465aa62e5102891f380d188492d&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.715_112&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§715.12(c)</a> of <a href="http://portal.ncua.lan/sites/elibrary/Documents/Exam%20Governance/Rules%20and%20Regulations/NCUA%20Rules%20and%20Regulations.pdf"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a>, the EIC may compel a federal credit union to obtain a financial statement audit performed in accordance with GAAS by an independent person who is licensed by the State or jurisdiction in which the credit union is principally located. If the supervisor and EIC determine that an opinion financial statement audit is necessary, the supervisor will notify the ARDP.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Audits" />If offsite monitoring and/or supervision contacts reveal major areas of concern with ongoing recordkeeping, audits, or verification of members’ accounts that have not been properly resolved within 180 days, the EIC will consult their supervisor and determine what administrative action is to be taken.</p>
        <p>Examiners will document offsite/onsite contacts by using the appropriate methods (AIRES, Confidential Section, etc.) and indicate the progress and actions taken.</p>
