They are a critical tool used to evaluate the integrity and fairness of the financial statements. They provide assurance of the reliability of the financial statements used by credit union management, members, creditors, insurers, and the NCUA. These financial reports are the basis for risk identification and offsite monitoring of the credit union system. Chapter 5 of the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/ExaminersGuide.flsnp" /> provides detailed discussion of Supervisory Committee Audits, instructions for reviewing the audit and engagement letter, and information on the review of member account verifications.</p>
        <p>Recordkeeping is the process of recording and maintaining sufficient information to trace all transactions to a point of origin. An effective recordkeeping program is bolstered by strong internal controls and facilitates the audit process. Audits rely on financial records to validate data integrity, identify inaccuracies, and decrease the risk of fraud.</p>
