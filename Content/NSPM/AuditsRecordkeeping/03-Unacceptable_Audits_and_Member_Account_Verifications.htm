            <MadCap:concept term="Audits" />Unacceptable Audits and Member Account Verifications</h2>
        <p>Examiners will consider an audit or verification unacceptable and develop plans of action when they determine:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Material parts of the audit or verification were not done</li>
            <li>Material parts of the audit or verification are not supported by work papers</li>
            <li>Material areas of credit union operations were not audited</li>
            <li>The auditor lacks independence from the credit union</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examiners</h3>
        <p>Examiners who discover material supervisory committee audit/Member Account Verifications deficiencies conducted by the SC or an external auditor that is not a licensed independent auditor or certified public accountant will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact their supervisor</li>
            <li>Determine if the audit can be cured timely (if not, discuss alternatives with their supervisor)</li>
            <li>Rate transaction risk as “high” or document the rationale for a different risk rating</li>
            <li>Denote this a major area of concern in the Examination Overview</li>
            <li>Prepare a DOR which provides a reasonable time period for the SC to correct the deficiencies, not longer than 120 days from the completion date of the exam, not longer than 120 days from the completion date of the exam</li>
            <li>Require the SC to provide a monthly status report of their progress to the examiner</li>
            <li>
                <p>Document deficiencies in the audit or Member Account Verification as a problem code using the DOR module</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Complete a follow-up supervision contact within 60 days of the DOR due date</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&#160;The supervisor must approve any extension beyond 60 days with notification to the ARDP.</li>
                    <li>&#160;The examiner must document any extensions in the Confidential Section during the next contact.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the audit or Member Account Verifications remains unacceptable, examiners will proceed in accordance with <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=f7487481e89b2eb482b7ff41baabd9c8&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se12.7.715_111&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">§715.11</a> of the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/Regs/Pages/Regulations.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/NCUA rules and regulations.flsnp" /></a> to obtain an acceptable audit or Member Account Verifications following the guidelines in chapter 5 of the <a href="http://www.ncua.gov/Legal/GuidesEtc/Pages/Examiners-Guide.aspx"><MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/ExaminersGuide.flsnp" /></a>.</p>
        <p>Recurring deficiencies for audit and Member Account Verifications are grounds to proceed to administrative actions. Examiners can consult with their supervisor to develop a more stringent supervision plan if needed. Additionally, the CAMEL Management component and overall rating should reflect management’s recurring non-compliance with this critical internal control area.</p>
